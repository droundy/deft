\abstract{
  We use Classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT) to predict the 
  freezing of a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) fluid, and construct
  pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. 
  A WCA fluid consists of soft spheres that exhibit the repulsive 
  portion of the Lennard-Jones potential widely used to model the

  using Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT) with Schmidt's error function 
  model in which we have incorporated temperature dependent parameters 
  to make the second virial coefficient correct. Our functional was 
  successful in predicting the freezing of the WCA fluid with a fairly 
  good match to Monte-Carlo simulations. This result suggests that SFMT 
  may provide a strong foundation for future density functionals that

\chapter{Introduction}

Classically, fluids have been modeled by a collection of small, 
impenetrable spheres colliding with one another like billiard balls. 
In the simplest case, the spheres are treated as having only a repulsive 
potential that rises instantly to infinity when the spheres make contact. 
This model, called the hard-sphere fluid, has served as the 
primary reference system for fluids. This is due to the fact that the 
short-range repulsion between atoms is much stronger than their long-range 
attraction, and thus dominates the interactions between atoms. 

In more recent times, other model fluids have been developed.
Zwanzig introduced the square-well 
fluid in 1954 which is a perturbation of the hard-sphere fluid created by adding 
a hard-edge short-range attractive potential to the repulsive potential of the 
hard-sphere fluid~\cite{ZwanzigSqrWell}. In 1964 Rowlinson studied 
spheres with softly fading short-range repulsive potentials which he modeled by making
the radius of hard spheres temperature dependent~\cite{rowlinson1964statistical}. 
This reflects the idea that soft-spheres penetrate more deeply into 
each other when they collide at higher temperatures. 
In 1967 Barker and Henderson combined the perturbation approach of Zwanzig 
with Rowlinson's idea of using temperature-dependent radii to model spheres 
with soft repulsive potentials using hard-spheres~\cite{barker1967perturbation}. 
In this model, 
%a soft-sphere fluid is modeled by using a hard-sphere fluid with 
hard spheres are given larger radii 
at low temperatures, and smaller radii at high temperatures. 
In 1971 Weeks, 
Chandler, and Anderson used temperature and density dependent hard-sphere 
radii to model spheres with a more realistic softly fading repulsive 
potential similar to that between neutral atoms.
%portion of the Leonard-Jones potential
Their is known as the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) model fluid~\cite{andersen1971relationship} . 
Models continue to be developed to characterize fluids with particular 
properties, or to address problems like surface tension, 
interfaces, adsorption, wetting and confinement.
A review of some model fluids and problems that have been
studied more recently is given by L\"{o}wen~\cite{lowen}.

While models for particular fluids were being created, powerful methods 
to predict the properties of fluids were also being developed. 
In the late 1950s, Scaled Particle Theory (SPT)~\cite{ReissSPT} was 
introduced from which an equation of state, and an expression for the 
excess Helmholtz free energy of a homogeneous hard-sphere fluid can be 
obtained~\cite{Hansen}. 
In 1958, Percus-Yevick introduced a method to describe the thermodynamics 
of the hard-sphere fluid based on an approximate closure to the 
Ornstein-Zernike integral equation~\cite{PercusYevick}.
%Percus and Yevick took another approach to the hard-sphere fluid.
In 1961 Morita and Hiroike introduced a density functional 
approach~\cite{MoritaDFT} to finding the equilibrium Grand and Helmholtz free energies  
%, and the corresponding equilibrium number density profile 
of a classical inhomogeneous fluid. 
Density functional theory was further developed for inhomogeneous classical fluids
by Stillinger and Buff (1962)~\cite{stillingerandbuff}, Lebowitz and 
Percus (1963)~\cite{lobowitzandpercus}, and Mermin (1965)~\cite{merium} among others. A review
of the development of cDFT is found in Fundamentals of Inhomogeneous fluids~\cite{inhomogeneousfluids}.

To use classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT), an expression for the free energy 
as a functional of a spatially varying average single-particle number density $n(\vec r)$
%that varies spatially 
is constructed for a particular fluid.
%DFT Evans 1979
%Led by the consistency between results from SPT and Percus-Yevick, 
In 1989 Rosenfeld introduced Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT)~\cite{rosenfeld1989,rosenfeld1988} 
to form a functional for the hard-sphere fluid based on the idea that 
%the lowest term in the virial expansion of the excess chemical potential 
the lowest order term in the virial expansion of the excess chemical 
potential of a hard-sphere fluid can 
be expressed in terms of a weighted density using a weight function 
%using a weight 
%function 
of the form of 
a backward Heaviside step function
%\begin{equation}
   %F_{ex}=k_BT\int_{volume} n(\vec r) \theta(|\vec r - \vec r'|-(\vec R_i + \vec R_j)) d\vec r
%\end{equation}
that can itself be expressed in terms of a sum of convolutions involving 
a set of weight functions related to the geometry of a sphere. 
For two spheres with radii, 
$R_i$  and $R_j$, the convolution is written as~\cite{rosenfeld1989}
\begin{displaymath}
   \Theta(|\vec r - \vec r'|-(R_i + R_j)) = w_i^{(3)} \otimes w_j^{(0)} + w_j^{(3)} \otimes w_i^{(0)} + w_i^{(1)} \otimes w_j^{(2)} + w_j^{(1)} \otimes w_i^{(2)}\end{displaymath}
\begin{equation}   + \vec w_i^{(1)} \otimes \vec w_j^{(2)} + \vec w_j^{(1)} \otimes \vec w_i^{(2)}
\end{equation}

FMT gives the same result for the excess Helmholtz free energy of the 
hard-sphere fluid as SPT does, from which it can be 
constructed~\cite{rosenfeld1989,Hansen,santos2012phi3}. It also gives the same 
result for the direct correlation function found by Percus-Yevick. 
However, it did not predict freezing due to one term in the expression that
diverged when the fluid was highly confined.  
Tarazona later solved this problem by introducing a tensor version of $\Phi_3$,
one of the energy density terms 
in the functional,~\cite{tarazonaphi3, santos2012phi3} 
which took into account the non-spherical, and thus 
non-symmetric, shape of the cavity in which the fluid is confined 
while also yielding the correct excess free energy for the fluid as its 
confinement is reduced from a three-dimensional volume (as in a bulk fluid), 
to a two-dimensional plane (as in a thin-film), to a one-dimensional 
line (as in a fluid confined to a capillary tube), to a zero-dimensional 
dot, as in an atom located at a lattice site within a crystal~\cite{rothreview}. 

In 1999 Schmidt adopted FMT for spheres with soft 
interatomic potential energies
(which rise to infinity over a distance, rather than instantaneously 
like the potential energy between hard spheres)
forming Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT)~\cite{schmidt1999density}. 
%by replacing $w^{(3)}$ with a weight function that would result in  
%soft interatomic potentials (which rise to infinity over a distance, 
%rather than instantaneously).
Schmidt applied his Soft Fundamental Measure Theory to various fluids, 
%with soft, short-range repulsive and attractive potentials, 
and developed 
an error function model 
%based on a Gaussian weight function 
for spheres with steep, short-range soft repulsive 
potentials~\cite{schmidt2000fluid}.
%, similar to that exhibited by a WCA fluid. 
For some more recent developments in classical Density Functional Theory, 
see the review by Evans ~\cite{evansreview} (2016), the book 
Theory of Simple Fluids by Hansen and McDonald~\cite{Hansen} (2013), 
and the paper by Tschopp and coworkers~\cite{BHextended} (2020) in which 
they extend the Barker-Henderson model to inhomogeneous 
fluids from first principles.

Classical density functional theory has also been applied 
to phase transitions, and freezing. In 1979 Ramakrishnan and Yussouff studied 
freezing by viewing a 
crystal as a highly inhomogeneous liquid~\cite{ramakrishnanandyussouff}. 
In 2010 Oettel and fellow researchers studied hard-sphere crystals with 
fully developed FMT~\cite{Oettel2010}, and 
in 2016 FMT was used to find the fluid and crystal phases of the 
Asakura-Oosawa model fluid~\cite{asakuraoosawa}. 
Lutsko and Lam studied studied crystallization of the Leonard-Jones 
fluid~\cite{lutsko} in 2018, and Lutsko and Schoonen looked at cDFT applied 
to the solid state~\cite{lutskoschoonen2020} in 2020.
In all these studies the hard-sphere fluid has been used as the reference 
system to which other terms are added to create 
the full functional for the fluid being studied.

In this paper, classical Density Functional Theory will be used to predict 
the freezing of a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson model fluid directly by applying 
SFMT with Schmidt's proposed error function model, 
in which we have incorporated our temperature dependent parameters to 
fit the functional to the soft-sphere WCA fluid.

%Newer Intro....
%The goal of this project is to generate temperature-density 
%and pressure-temperature phase diagrams for a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson 
%(WCA) model fluid using classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT). 
%To do this, the Helmholtz free energies of the fluid
%in a fluid state and in a crystalline solid state must be found.
%In general, the Helmholtz free energy, which consists of an ideal part 
%and an excess part, can be written as a functional of the number density 
%profile $n(\vec{r})$ which describes the way the average number 
%density varies spatially. 
%\begin{equation}{F[n(\vec{r})]=F_{ideal}[n(\vec{r})] + F_{excess}[n(\vec{r})]}\end{equation} 

%Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT) will be used to form the 
%functional for the excess Helmholtz free energy. 
%SFMT is a method that makes the task of 
%forming an expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy of a particular 
%model fluid much easier since the interaction that each sphere, or atom, 
%has with every other sphere does not have to be taken explicitly into account.
%Once the functional for the Helmholtz free energy is formed, then 
%according to cDFT, the equilibrium
%Helmholtz free energy of the system can be found for a particular 
%temperature and density by varying the number 
%density profile $n(\vec{r})$ until the free energy is minimized. 
%Phase diagrams can then be constructed using Maxwell's Double Tangent Construction. 
%Results will be compared to those from Monte-Carlo simulations.

\section{Model Fluids and the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson Fluid (WCA)}

Real fluids and their behavior are very complex from a physicist's point 
of view. Although a water molecule, for example, is composed of only three
atoms, the ever-changing redistribution of charges within the molecules, 
and their interaction with charges from other molecules make it difficult 
to study a fluid composed of water molecules directly. The task becomes 
even more daunting considering the complicated molecular motion of each 
water molecule, and the sheer number of molecules that must be taken 
into account. 
The problem of understanding the behavior of real liquids is better addressed 
by using models which reduce a complex picture to a simple one. Modifications, 
or perturbations, can then be incorporated into the model making it 
progressively more complex until it mimics the behavior of a real 
liquid as closely as possible.

In developing a model for a fluid, simplifications can be made regarding 
the composition, type, shape, and interatomic interaction of the molecules. 
Rather than dealing with any particular molecule or atom, the model only 
deals with generic ``particles", which may also be referred to as ``atoms''. 
The shape of the particles, or atoms will be the simplest shape possible - 
a sphere. The spheres in the simplest models do not exhibit quantum 
interference effects as the mass of the spheres, and the temperature 
are taken to be large enough that the de Broglie wavelength is smaller 
than the mean distance between the spheres. The fluid can then be treated 
as a classical fluid where the spheres interact with each other according 
to their interatomic potential. 

There are many interatomic potentials which can be used to model a fluid 
each of which describes the interaction between two real atoms to some 
degree of accuracy. The simplest, and oldest, model used to describe a 
fluid is the hard-sphere model. The hard-sphere model envisions a fluid 
to be composed of hard spheres like, for example, a collection of marbles. 
This model came about by considering the near incompressibility of liquids 
indicating that the particles making up the liquid strongly resist being 
pushed closer together. This behavior can be described by an interatomic 
potential energy that is zero when two spheres are not in contact, but 
goes instantly to infinity when contact is made, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:HardSphere_potential}. The inability to push 
real atoms closer together is due to the repulsion of the electrons in 
each atom, and is the dominating interparticle electrostatic interaction. 
Thus, the hard-sphere model - which is the simplest, but still effective 
representation of this repulsive behavior that dominates the interaction 
between real atoms, is currently the most widely used model for fluids.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{plot_HardSphere_Potential.pdf}
    \caption{A hard-sphere potential is zero for $r>2R$, and infinity 
    for $r<{2R}$ where R is the radius of a hard sphere 
    (R$=\frac{r}{2}\approx$1.22/2=0.61 in this example).}
    \label{fig:HardSphere_potential}
  \end{figure}

Another fairly simple, but relatively accurate interatomic potential widely 
used to represent generic, neutral atoms is the Lennard-Jones potential. 
The Lennard-Jones potential describes both the long-range attraction, 
and the short-range repulsion that occurs between two neutral atoms. 
The attraction between two neutral atoms is due to fleeting dipoles that 
form spontaneously when electrons are redistributed as atoms come into 
close proximity. These are often characterized as Van der Walls, or London 
dispersion forces. The attraction grows stronger as two atoms move closer 
together until their atomic orbitals begin to overlap. 
At this point the electrons in each atom begin to oppose the overlap of 
the two atoms through their repulsion. The repulsion increases rapidly and 
approaches infinity as the distance between the atoms continues to decrease.  
 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{LJ_Potential.pdf}
    \caption{Lennard-Jones potential for $\sigma=1$, $\epsilon=1$}
    \label{fig:LJ_potential}
  \end{figure}

The combined attractive and repulsive effects produce the overall shape of 
the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential shown in Figure \ref{fig:LJ_potential}. 
The potential is zero when the distance r between the centers of two atoms 
is equal to $\sigma$. 
%At this point the attraction between the atoms just cancels their repulsion. 
As the distance 
between the centers of the two atoms decreases below $\sigma$, the potential 
rapidly approaches positive infinity corresponding to infinite repulsion. 
Above $\sigma$ the potential becomes negative indicating a net attractive energy 
between the atoms, even though the force may be repulsive. 
The net attractive energy is maximized at a distance of 
r=$2^\frac{1}{6}\sigma=2R\approx{1.122}\sigma$ where R is the radius of 
the sphere given by $R={2^{-\frac{5}{6}}}\sigma$. At this point the depth of
the potential well, given by epsilon $\epsilon$, is a maximum, and the force
between the spheres is zero. As r increases 
further, the net attractive energy decreases and the potential approaches zero
asymptotically. The attractive and repulsive forces can be separated into two
potentials, shown with different colors in Figure \ref{fig:LJ_potential_2parts}, 
which when added together regenerate the full Lennard-Jones potential. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{LJ_Potential_2part.pdf}
    \caption{Lennard-Jones potential broken into two parts}
    \label{fig:LJ_potential_2parts}
  \end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{WCA_Potential.pdf}
    \caption{WCA potential}
    \label{fig:WCA_potential}
  \end{figure}

The repulsive portion of the Lennard-Jones potential forms the potential for a 
Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) model fluid~\cite{andersen1971relationship},
shown in Figure \ref{fig:WCA_potential}. 
The WCA potential is described by the equation 
\begin{align} \label{eq:VWCA}
    V_{WCA}=\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} {4\epsilon{\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right]}+\epsilon} & \mbox{for} & 0<r<{2R} \\ 0 & \mbox{for} & r>2R \end{array}\right.
\end{align} 
The WCA potential decreases as the distance between the 
centers of the atoms r increases, and becomes, and remains, essentially 
zero when r=$2^\frac{1}{6}\sigma=2R\approx{1.122}\sigma$ where R is the 
radius of the sphere. 
As with the Lenard-Jones potential, the repulsive WCA potential increases 
rapidly and approaches infinity as the two spheres begin to overlap. This 
is a more realistic repulsive potential than that of the hard-sphere model 
which goes instantly to infinity when the two spheres make contact (at r=2R), 
and is zero otherwise. Because the WCA spheres have no hard boundary in 
their interatomic potential, they are called ``soft spheres'' and their 
gradually fading potential makes them slightly ``squishy'', as pictured in
Figure~\ref{fig:TwoSpheres}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{figs/TwoSpheres.pdf} 
    \caption{(Left) The WCA potential is zero at r=2R. 
             (Right) The WCA potential increases rapidly for $r<2R$.}
    \label{fig:TwoSpheres}

\section{Freezing and the Construction of Phase Diagrams}

%Freezing of simple fluids is governed by entropy, which the universe
%seeks to maximize according to the second law of Thermodynamics. When the 
%entropy of a pure substance in its liquid state is lower than the entropy 
%that it would have in its solid state at the same temperature (necessary 
%for thermal equilibrium with the environment), the same pressure (necessary for mechanical 
%equilibrium with the environment), and the same chemical potential (necessary for diffusive 
%equilibrium with the environment), a phase transition occurs, that is, the liquid 
%freezes. 
%%Along the phase boundary between pure liquid and pure solid states, both 
%%liquid and solid states can coexist in equilibrium. 
%Freezing of simple fluids can be seen when the entropy that a pure substance 
%would have in a liquid state is lower than the entropy 
%that it would have in its solid state at the same temperature (necessary 
%for thermal equilibrium), the same pressure (necessary for mechanical 
%equilibrium), and the same chemical potential (necessary for diffusive 
%equilibrium). 
 
%A liquid will eventually freeze as heat is removed, or the liquid is compressed, and 
A system will be solid when the free energy it would have as a solid is lower 
than the free energy that it has as a liquid at the same temperature and density.
At the phase transition the density will change abruptly, and
the particular structure and density that result will be affected 
by the interatomic potential. When repulsive, soft sphere fluids 
(that are not too soft) freeze, they form lattice structures composed of 
Face Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal cells~\cite{Hansen}, as do hard spheres. 
This structure is what one would see by filling a box with marbles. It 
results in the highest density achievable for hard, and nearly-hard, spheres 
that are purely repulsive. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{figs/P-T_Diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Conceptual Pressure-Temperature Phase Diagram}
    \label{fig:P-T_Diagram}
\end{figure}

A phase transition occurs along a phase boundary line %on a phase diagram
such as can be seen in the pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:P-T_Diagram}. 
%
%Points along the phase boundary that separates the solid and the fluid phases 
%indicate a phase transition where the solid and fluid phases coexist, 
%and show that both the solid and the fluid have the same temperature (necessary 
%for thermal equilibrium)
%and the same pressure (necessary for mechanical 
%equilibrium)at a phase transition, and the same chemical potential 
%(necessary for diffusive equilibrium). 
%
This phase diagram is 
representative of some substance 
which exhibits both attraction and repulsion. However, since 
the atoms in a WCA fluid do not exhibit attraction there will not be a 
dividing line between the gas and liquid phases, there will simply
be a fluid.
The phase diagram indicates the equilibrium state a substance will be in at
different temperatures and pressures.
At a phase transition, both the fluid and the solid have 
the same temperature (necessary 
for thermal equilibrium), the same pressure (necessary for mechanical 
equilibrium) and the same chemical potential (necessary for diffusive equilibrium).
%The temperature , pressure, and chemical potential will be the same for both
%the fluid and the solid at a fluid-solid phase transition. 

The pressure can be related to the Helmholtz free energy F, which is minimized 
for a system at fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles, as the 
entropy of the system and its surroundings added together is maximized. The negative of 
the partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the volume V 
at a fixed temperature T and number of particles N, equals the pressure. 
\begin{equation}{P=-\frac{\partial{F}}{\partial{V}}\bigg|_{T,N}}\end{equation}
\noindent Dividing both the Helmholtz free energy and the volume by the 
number of particles, the partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy 
with respect to volume becomes the partial derivative of the Helmholtz 
free energy per atom, $f$,  with respect to the inverse number density. 
\begin{equation}{P=-\frac{\partial{\frac{F}{N}}}{\partial{\frac{V}{N}}}\bigg|_{T,N} = -\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\frac{1}{n}}}\bigg|_{T,N}}\end{equation} 
Thus, the pressure corresponds to the negative of the slope of the curve 
on a plot of the Helmholtz free energy per atom versus the inverse 
density at fixed temperature. 
 
 \begin{figure}
    \centering
     \includegraphics[height=8cm]{figs/MaxwellDTC-Fig1.pdf}
    \caption{Fluid and solid densities at the fluid-solid phase 
    transition are identified using Maxwell's Double Tangent Construction}
    \label{fig:MaxwellDT}
  \end{figure}

Two such curves are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MaxwellDT}, one for the fluid
and one for the solid at a fixed temperature. 
%Each curve consists of a collection of data points $(\frac{F}{N}, \frac{1}{n})$ 
The data for the curves 
%and the solid respectively, which 
will be obtained by using cDFT. 
%to find the Helmholtz free energies of the fluid and the solid for various 
%temperatures and number densities. 
Since the pressure of the 
fluid is the same as the pressure of the solid at the phase transition, 
the density of the fluid and the density of the solid at 
freezing can be found from identifying the points at which the 
tangents to each curve have the same slope, as shown by the black line. 
This process is called Maxwell's Double Tangent Construction. 

To facilitate finding the pressure at the phase transition computationally, 
it is helpful to take different approach by considering the Gibbs free energy given by G=F+PV. 
Rearranging the terms and dividing by N gives an  expression for the 
Helmholtz free energy per atom $f$ in terms of the Gibbs free energy 
per atom  $g$ (which is the chemical potential)  
\begin{equation}\frac{F}{N} = -P\frac{V}{N}+\frac{G}{N} \end{equation}
\begin{align}f=-P\frac{1}{n}+g\end{align}
This equation has the form of a line
\begin{equation}
    y=mx+y_o
\end{equation}
and describes the black line shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MaxwellDT} where the 
pressure is given by the negative of the slope of the line, and the Gibb's 
free energy per atom, or chemical potential is given by the y-intercept. 
At the phase transition the chemical potential of the fluid is 
the same as the chemical potential of the solid, as is the pressure.
\begin{equation}
    \mu_F=\mu_S\mbox{~~~~and~~~~}P_F=P_S\mbox{~~~~at a phase transition}
\end{equation} 

 \begin{figure}
    \centering
     \includegraphics[height=8cm]{figs/MaxwellDTC-Fig2.pdf}
    \caption{Pressure is found at the point of intersection where $\mu_F=\mu_S$.}
    \label{fig:GibbsvsP}
  \end{figure}
  
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=8cm]{figs/MaxwellDTC-Fig3.pdf}
    \caption{The fluid and solid densities at the phase transition are 
    found from a plot of pressure vs inverse density for both the fluid and the solid.}
    \label{fig:Pvsinvn}
  \end{figure}

The pressure at the phase transition can be obtained from the point of 
intersection that occurs when the chemical potential 
is plotted against the pressure for both the fluid and the 
solid at fixed temperature, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GibbsvsP}. 
This plot is constructed from data collected from lines tangent 
along the curves on Helmholtz free energy per atom verses inverse 
density plots (like that of Figure~\ref{fig:MaxwellDT}) for both the 
fluid and the solid at a given temperature where 
the slope of the tangent line at a given point gives the negative of the 
pressure, and the corresponding y-intercept of the tangent 
line gives the chemical potential at a given point. 
%Collecting this data 
%(P,~$\mu$) at each point for the fluid and the solid respectively, 
%produces the curves in Figure~\ref{fig:GibbsvsP}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{figs/T-n_Diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Conceptual Temperature-Density Phase Diagram used to identify 
    the number densities of the fluid and the solid at a phase 
    transition. The gray region is where different phases coexist in 
    varying amounts at their phase transition number densities.}
    \label{fig:T-n_Diagram}
  \end{figure} 
  
Once the pressure is known at the point of phase transition, for a given 
temperature and number density, the fluid and solid number densities at 
the phase transition can be found from plots of the pressure versus the 
inverse of the number density for both the solid and the fluid, 
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pvsinvn}. By repeating this procedure to 
find the fluid and solid number densities at the phase transition 
for various temperatures, a temperature-density (T-n) phase diagram 
can be generated, similar to that shown in Figure \ref{fig:T-n_Diagram}. 
However, for a WCA fluid there will be no gray hump which is characteristic 
of fluids that have attractive interatomic potentials, and which display
an interface between vapor and liquid at temperatures below the critical point.

\section{Classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT)}

Classical Density Functional Theory will be used to find the 
Helmholtz free energies of the fluid and the solid for various 
temperatures and number densities, so that phase diagrams can be 
constructed. 
The key idea behind classical Density Functional Theory is that 
free energy can be written as a functional (a function of a function) of 
a number density profile $n(\vec{r})$ which describes the way the number 
density, or atoms per volume, varies spatially on average. 
\begin{displaymath}{f[n(}\vec{r}{)]}\end{displaymath}
This, coupled with the fact that the free energy of a system tends toward 
a minimum at equilibrium means that the equilibrium free energy of the 
system $f_{eq}[n_{eq}(\vec r)]$, and its corresponding equilibrium 
number density profile $n_{eq}(\vec r)$, can be found simply by varying 
$n(\vec{r})$ through all possible spatial profiles until the free energy 
is minimized~\cite{MoritaDFT}. 
\begin{displaymath}f[n(\vec r)]\rightarrow f_{eq}[n_{eq}(\vec r)]  \mbox{ as $f$ is minimized} \end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}{\mbox{where }  n(\vec{r})=n_{eq}(\vec r)  \mbox{ at equilibrium}}\end{displaymath}
The reason the minimization works is because DFT satisfies the conditions 
of the variational principle.

A description of cDFT often begins with considering the Grand Free 
Energy defined as
\begin{equation}\Omega=F-\mu{N}\end{equation}
which can then be expressed in terms of a varying number density 
profile $n(\vec r)$
\begin{equation}\label{GrandFE}\Omega= F_{int} +\int n(\vec{r})\phi_{ext}{(\vec r)}d\vec{r}-\mu\int n(\vec r)d\vec{r}\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\int n(\vec r)d\vec{r}=N\end{equation}%
and the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy is defined as
\begin{equation}F_{int} = F - \int n(\vec{r})V_{ext}{(\vec r)}d\vec{r}\end{equation}  
%The quantity $\phi_{ext}$
where $V_{ext}$ is an externally applied potential. 
The Grand free energy is applicable to systems with a varying number of 
particles and fixed chemical potential, temperature and volume. But in 
this paper a system with a fixed temperature, volume, and number of 
particles will be of interest in which case
%\begin{equation}\int n(\vec r)d\vec{r}=N\end{equation} and so
the Grand free energy is constrained
\begin{equation}\label{GrandFE}\Omega_{constrained}= F[n(\vec r)]-\mu N\end{equation}
The dependence on $n(\vec r)$ is now only present in the expression for 
the Helmholtz free energy, and so it is the Helmholtz energy as a functional 
of the number density profile $F[n(\vec r)]$ that is minimized at equilibrium. 
More specifically, in this paper, the Helmholtz free energy per particle, 
or atom,  $f_N=\frac{F}{N}$ will be minimized which is given by
\begin{equation}f_N=\frac{U}{N}-\frac{TS}{N}\end{equation}
with differential
\begin{equation}\label{usetoshowmin}df_N=d\left(\frac{U}{N}\right)-d\left(\frac{TS}{N}\right)\end{equation}
\begin{equation}df_N=-\frac{S}{N}dT-\frac{P}{N}dV-PVd\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\end{equation}
%This result shows that the natural variables of the Helmholtz free energy 
%per particle $f_N$ are temperature, volume and one over the number of 
%particles, which in turn also holds the number density $n=\frac{V}{N}$ fixed. 
%\begin{equation}f_N(T,V, \frac{1}{N})\end{equation}
%Taking the differential
which can be set equal to 
\begin{displaymath}df_N=\frac{\partial f_N}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,\frac{1}{N}}dT 
+\frac{\partial f_N}{V}\bigg|_{T,\frac{1}{N}}dV + \frac{\partial f_N}
{\partial \left(\frac{1}{N}\right)}\bigg|_{T,V}d\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\end{displaymath}
Using the relation
\begin{displaymath}d\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)=Vd\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)+\frac{1}{N}dV\end{displaymath}
we get
\begin{displaymath}df_N=\frac{\partial f_N}{\partial T}\bigg|_{\frac{1}{n}}dT 
+ \frac{\partial f_N}{\partial \frac{1}{n}}\bigg|_{T}d\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{displaymath}
\begin{equation}f_N(T,\frac{1}{n})\end{equation}
This result shows that temperature and the inverse number density, 
or volume per particle, are natural variables of the Helmholtz free energy 
per particle $f_N$.
%which will thus be minimized when these natural variables are held fixed.

The minimization can be illustrated for a system near 
equilibrium by considering that according to the 
second law of thermodynamics, a system that is not in equilibrium will 
experience spontaneous processes that increase the total entropy of a 
system and its surroundings until equilibrium is reached
\begin{align}
    \Delta{S}_{System + Surroundings} \geq 0 
\end{align}
Here "surroundings" means 
the entire universe minus the system. This, together with the conservation 
of energy (the first law of thermodynamics) which says that energy lost 
(or gained) by the system is gained (or lost) by the surroundings 
\begin{align}
    \Delta{U}_{System}=-\Delta{U}_{Surroundings} 
\end{align}
gives the result that 
changes in the free energy 
will be negative for spontaneous processes 
when the natural variables of the free energy are held fixed. 
For our case, the temperature and inverse number density are the natural 
variables, and so holding these fixed we get
%Rewriting Eq~\ref{usetoshowmin} to show the system terms explicitly
%\begin{equation}
  %df_{System}=d\left(\frac{U}{N}\right)_{System}-Td\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)_{System}+\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)dT_{System}
%\end{equation}
%and holding the temperature fixed ($T_{System}=T_{Surroundings}$) so that 
%$dT=0$ gives
%\begin{equation}
  %f_{System}=-d\left(\frac{U}{N}\right)_{Surroundings}-Td\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)_{System}
%\end{equation}
%where conservation of energy was also applied. Fixing the volume and the 
%number of particles, so that $dV=0$ and $d\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)=0$, 
%results in
\begin{equation}
  df_{N~System}=-\left(\frac{T}{N}\right)dS_{System+Surroundings}
\end{equation}
%which, for fixed N, is the same as
%\begin{equation}dF_{System}=-TdS_{System+Surroundings} \end{equation} 
%Since $dS_{System+Surroundings} \geq{0}$, and the temperature and number 
%of particles are fixed, the change in the free energy of the system will 
%always be negative, and thus the free energy tends toward a minimum.
%~\cite{schroeder}. 
Since the changes in the total entropy are always positive, the changes
in the free energy are negative and the free energy tends toward a minimum. 
Details of this procedure be found in Thermal Physics by Schroeder~\cite{schroeder}, 
and a proof of minimization in general can be found in 
Theory of Simple Fluids by Hansen and McDonald~\cite{Hansen}.

The Helmholtz free energy can be written as
\begin{equation}{F=-k_{B}T\ln(Z)}\end{equation}
which results from equating the expressions for the Helmholtz free energy 
from thermodynamics to those of statistical mechanics. The paritian function 
Z is integrated over all of phase space for N identical particles each with 
a momentum $\vec{p}$ and a position $\vec{r}$, and is given by
\begin{align}  \label{Z_total}
     Z=\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int{dP}\int{dQ}~e^\frac{-H(\vec{p}_1,\vec{p}_2,...\vec{p}_N,\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2,...\vec{r}_N)}{k_BT}
\end{align}
where
\begin{displaymath}{dP=d\vec{p}_1d\vec{p}_2...d\vec{p}_N \mbox{~~~~and~each~} d\vec{p}=dp_xdp_ydp_z}\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}{dQ=d\vec{r}_1d\vec{r}_2...d\vec{r}_N \mbox{~~~~and~each~} d\vec{r}=dxdydz\mbox{~~~~}}\end{displaymath}
Writing the Hamiltonian, H in terms of its component kinetic and potential energies gives
\begin{equation}\label{Hamiltonian}{H = KE + V = \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\frac{|\vec{p}_i|^2}{2m}\right)+V(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,{...},\vec{r}_N)}\end{equation}
where the translational kinetic energy of the N atoms is given by 
\begin{equation}{\text{KE}=\sum_{i=1}^N\left(\frac{|\vec{p}_i|^2}{2m}\right)}\end{equation}
and the potential energy of the total interaction of each atom with the other 
N-1 atoms is given by
\begin{displaymath}{V(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,{...},\vec{r}_N)}\end{displaymath} 
%and where \begin{displaymath}{V_{ext}(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,{...},\vec{r}_N)}\end{displaymath} 
%is an externally applied potential that varies spatially, such that its 
%effects on each atom depend on the atom's position. Often $V_{ext}$ is 
%set to zero, as it is in this paper. 

Noting that the kinetic energy depends only on momentum while the total 
interatomic and external potential energies depend only on position, 
the integral in Equation~\ref{Z_total} can be separated into two parts 
\begin{equation}{Z=\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int{dP}~e^\frac{-\left(\frac{|\vec{p}_1|^2}{2m}
+\frac{|\vec{p}_2|^2}{2m}+...\frac{|\vec{p}_N|^2}{2m}\right)}{k_BT}\int{dQ}
~e^\frac{-V(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,{...},\vec{r}_N)}{k_BT}}\end{equation}  
Multiplying by $\frac{V^N}{V^N}$ where V is the real space volume, and 
\begin{equation}V^N=\int dQ\end{equation} 
the partitian function can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{Zmultiply}{Z=Z_{ideal}Z_{excess}}\end{equation}
where
\begin{align} \label{eq:Zideal}
    Z_{ideal}=V^N\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int{dP}~e^\frac{-\left(\frac{|\vec{p}_1|^2}{2m}+ \frac{|\vec{p}_2|^2}{2m}+...\frac{|\vec{p}_N|^2}{2m}\right)}{k_BT}
\end{align}
\begin{align} \label{eq:Zexcess}
    Z_{excess}=\frac{1}{V^N}\int{dQ}~e^\frac{-V(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,{...},\vec{r}_N)}{k_BT}
\end{align} 
The ideal partitian function $Z_{ideal}$ is that of an ideal gas.
%an ideal gas which exhibits no interaction between the atoms - a condition approached 
%by a gas at low density where the atoms rarely encounter one another. 
The excess partitian function $Z_{excess}$ accounts for the interaction 
of all the atoms according to their interatomic potential. 

Using Equation~\ref{Zmultiply}, the free energy can also be broken into two parts.
%\begin{equation}{F=-k_{B}T\ln(Z_{ideal}Z_{excess})}\end{equation}
\begin{align} \label{eq:Finparts}
     F &= -k_{B}T\ln(Z_{ideal}Z_{excess})  \\
       &= -k_{B}T\ln(Z_{ideal})-k_{B}T\ln(Z_{excess}) \\
       &= F_{ideal} + F_{excess}
\end{align}
%\begin{equation}{F=F_{ideal} + F_{excess}}\end{equation} 

The ideal Helmholtz free energy is given by 
%(put Equation~\ref{eq:Zideal} into Equation~\ref{eq:Finparts})
\begin{align}
    F_{ideal} &= -k_{B}T\ln(Z_{ideal}) \\
              &= -k_BT\ln{\left(V^N\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int{dP}~e^\frac{-\left(\frac{|\vec{p}_1|^2}{2m}+ \frac{|\vec{p}_2|^2}{2m}+...\frac{|\vec{p}_N|^2}{2m}\right)}{k_BT}\right)} 
\end{align}  
\begin{equation}{\label{Fidealmultipleint}}{=-k_BT\ln\left(V^N\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3}}\int{d\vec{p}_1}~e^\frac{-\frac{|\vec{p}_1|^2}{2m}}{k_BT}\frac{1}{h^{3}}\int{d\vec{p}_2}~e^\frac{-\frac{|\vec{p}_2|^2}{2m}}{k_BT}{...}\frac{1}{h^{3}}\int{d\vec{p}_N}~e^\frac{-\frac{|\vec{p}_N|^2}{2m}}{k_BT}\right)}\end{equation}
These integrals can conveniently be written in terms of the de Broglie 
wavelength $\Lambda$, or the quantum volume $\text{n}_\text{Q}$
\begin{equation}{\frac{1}{h^{3}}\int{d\vec{p}}~e^\frac{-\frac{|\vec{p}|^2}{2m}}{k_BT}=\left(\sqrt{\frac{k_BTm}{2\pi\hbar^2}}\right)^3=\frac{1}{\Lambda^{3}}}=\text{n}_\text{Q}\end{equation} 
where \begin{equation}{\Lambda =\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{k_BTm}}}\end{equation} 
Rewriting Equation~\ref{Fidealmultipleint} in terms of $\Lambda$ gives
\begin{equation}{F_{ideal}= -k_BT[\ln(V^N)-\ln(N!) - \ln(\Lambda^{3N})]}\end{equation}
Using Stirling's approximation \begin{equation}{\ln(N!)=N\ln{N}-N}\end{equation} 
this becomes
\begin{equation}F_{ideal}= k_BT[N\ln\left(\frac{N\Lambda^{3}}{V}\right)-N]\end{equation} 
Rewriting the equation in terms of the number density $n=\frac{N}{V}$, 
and the quantum volume, $\text{n}_\text{Q}$ gives
\begin{equation}{F_{ideal}= k_BT\left[\frac{N}{V}\ln{\left(\frac{N}{V}\frac{1}{\text{n}_\text{Q}}\right)}-\frac{N}{V}\right]}V\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Fideal}{F_{ideal}= k_BT[n\ln(n/\text{n}_\text{Q})-n]V}\end{equation}   
For a spatially varying number density, the ideal free energy in 
Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Fideal-n(r)}{F_{ideal}[n(\vec{r})]= k_BT\int_{Volume}[n(\vec{r})\ln(n(\vec{r})/\text{n}_\text{Q})-n(\vec{r})]~d\vec{r}}\end{equation} 

%Putting Equation~\ref{eq:Zexcess} into Equation~\ref{eq:Finparts}, 
The excess Helmholtz free energy is written most generally as
\begin{align}
      F_{excess} &= -k_{B}T\ln(Z_{excess}) \\
                 &= -k_BT\ln{\left(\frac{1}{V^N}\int{dQ}~e^\frac{-V(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2,...\vec{r}_N)}{k_BT}\right)} \label{Fexcess-mostgeneral}
\end{align} 
This integral can be somewhat simplified if it can be assumed that the 
potential energy $V(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2},...\vec{r_N})$ is a sum of the 
potential energies between pairs of atoms, where each atom is paired in 
turn with each of the other atoms in the system. In this case 
$V(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2,...\vec{r}_N)$ becomes 
\begin{equation}{V(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2},...\vec{r_N})=\frac{1}{2}\sum^N_i\sum^N_{j\neq{i}}V_{ij}(\vec{r_i},\vec{r_j})}\end{equation} 
Using this potential, and setting the external potential 
$V_{ext}(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2,...\vec{r}_N)$ to zero, the exponent in 
Equation~\ref{Fexcess-mostgeneral} becomes

\begin{equation}{e^{-\frac{\frac{1}{2}\sum^N_i\sum^N_{j\neq{i}}V_{ij}(\vec{r_i},
\vec{r_j})}{k_BT}}=e^{\frac{-V_{12}(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2})}{k_BT}}e^{-\frac{V_{13}
(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_3})}{k_BT}}e^{-\frac{V_{14}(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_4})}{k_BT}}...}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}{=-(1+f_{12})(1+f_{13})(1+f_{14})...}\end{equation}
%where each exponential term is simplified by a Taylor expansion $e^x\approx{1+x}$.  
where function $f_{ij}$ is the Mayer function given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:mayerfunction}
     f_{ij}(\vec{r_i},\vec{r_j})=e^{-\frac{V_{ij}(\vec{r_i},\vec{r_j})}{k_BT}}-1
\end{align} 
Multiplying the Mayer function terms, the excess free energy can be 
written as~\cite{schroeder}
\begin{align} \label{eq:Fexcess-simplified}
    F_{excess}=-k_BT\ln{\left(\frac{1}{V^N}\int{dQ}\left[1 + \sum{f_{ij}} + \sum{f_{ij}f_{kl}} +\sum{f_{ij}f_{kl}f_{mn}} +... \right]\right)}
\end{align}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{figs/diagrammic.pdf}
    \caption{Two-pair interactions $f_{ij}f_{kl}$ are shown for N=4 atoms. 
    Interactions between individual pairs of atoms are shown in green. 
    Interactions between pairs of atoms with an atom shared in common 
    are shown in red. At low densities only the green interactions
    are considered, since atoms are not likely to be clustered.}
    \label{fig:diagrammic}
  \end{figure}

Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified} is difficult to solve in general, 
but it can be solved for low densities, and this provides a way to check
a more general solution.
At low densities, it is not likely to find more than two atoms in close 
proximity, and so only interactions between individual pairs of spheres, 
such as those shown in green in Figure~\ref{fig:diagrammic}, are considered.
Each pair can then be described by a function of the distance between the 
two atoms in the pair. 
With a careful counting of the resulting number of such pairs, the 
low-density excess free energy for a homogeneous fluid can then be 
written~\cite{schroeder} as
\begin{align}\label{eq:Fexcess}
    F_{excess} &\approx k_BTn^2\int d\vec {r}~'\int d\vec {r}~"\left(-\frac{1}{2}f(|\vec {r}~'-\vec {r}~"|)\right) \\
               &\approx k_BTn^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\int{f(r)}{d\vec{r}}\right)V
    %\frac{F_{excess}}{N} &\approx k_BTn\left(-\frac{1}{2}\int{f(r)}{d\vec{r}}\right)
\end{align} 
in the thermodynamic limit of large N. 
The quantity in parenthesis can be recognized 
as the second virial expansion coefficient typically called $B_2$. 
A correct expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy should 
reduce to this result in the low-density limit. 
Outside of the low density limit, it is quite difficult to evaluate the 
excess Helmholtz free energy given in Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}. 
SFMT, discussed in the next section, provides a way around this problem
for some types of fluids.

Once an expression for the Helmholtz free energy as a functional of the
number density profile $n(\vec r)$ is formed then, according to classical 
Density Functional Theory, the equilibrium value of the 
Helmholtz energy, and its corresponding equilibrium density profile can be
found by varying the number density profile
at some fixed temperature until the free energy is minimized.  
 
%In this section 
%a functional for the Helmholtz free energy was formed by finding 
%general expressions for the ideal and the excess portions of the free 
%energy, and adding them together.
%\begin{equation}{F[n(\vec{r})]=F_{ideal}[n(\vec{r})] + F_{excess}[n(\vec{r})]}\end{equation}
%The functional for the ideal portion of the Helmholtz free energy is given by 
%Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal-n(r)}, and a functional for the excess portion of the Helmholtz 
%free energy is given in Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}. The specific 
%form for the excess Helmholtz free energy depends on the particular 
%fluid being modeled as defined by the  
%interatomic potential energy V(r) between the spheres, which can make
%forming an expression difficult. In this paper, Soft Fundamental Measure
%Theory will be used to form an expression for the excess Helmholtz free 
%energy, as explained in the next section.

\section{Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT)}
Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT) is a method for forming an 
approximation for the excess Helmholtz free energy of a soft-sphere fluid.
In the next chapter, 
we will adapt an SFMT functional to fit the soft-sphere WCA fluid.
Recall that in order to apply classical Density Functional Theory 
to a system that has a fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles, 
a functional for the Helmholtz free energy must first be formed. 
The ideal portion of the Helmholtz free energy is given by 
Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal-n(r)}, but forming an expression for the excess 
Helmholtz free energy from Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified} for the 
particular fluid being modeled can be challenging. 
SFMT is a method for forming an 
expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy
that does not depend on explicitly taking into account the interaction 
that each sphere has with every other sphere in the fluid (as required by 
Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}).
%In the next chapter on methods, we will use an SFMT functional that we 
%adapt to fit the soft-sphere WCA fluid.
SFMT was developed by Schmidt~\cite{schmidt1999density, schmidt2000fluid} 
for soft-spheres, and is an extension of Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) 
originally developed by 
Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989, rosenfeld1994, rosenfeld1996, fmtfromsptandsignerror} 
for the hard-sphere fluid. 
%FMT in turn extended  
%Scaled Particle Theory (SPT)~\cite{ReissSPT, santos2012phi3}, which was 
%developed for homogeneous hard-sphere fluids, 
%to inhomogeneous, or non-uniform hard-sphere fluids.

%\textcolor{red}{FROM HERE}
%\begin{equation}{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-R)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} 1 & 0<r \leq R \\ 0  & r>R \end{array}\right.}\end{equation}
%Rosenfeld begins the development of FMT by considering the lowest order 
%term in the virial expansion of the excess chemical potential.
%Taking the partial derivative of the free energy in the low density limit given 
%by Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess} gives
%\begin{align}
   %\mu_{ex} &= \frac{\partial{F_{ex}}}{\partial{N}}\bigg|_{T,V} \nonumber \\
            %&= k_BT\int -f(r)~n~d\vec r
%\end{align}
Rosenfeld, who was studying mixtures, begins the development of FMT by considering that 
for a hard-sphere fluid the Mayer function, $f(r)$, can be written in terms 
of a backward Heaviside step function $\Theta$ which, for a hard-sphere fluid 
composed of a mixture of spheres of radius $R_i$ and $R_j$, is
given by
\begin{align} 
    f(r_{ij}) = -\Theta(r_{ij}-(R_i + R_j))
\end{align}
where $r_{ij}=|\vec r_i - \vec r_j|$ is the distance between the centers of two spheres, 
and $\Theta$ is 1 for $r_{ij}<R_i+R_j$ and 0 for $r_{ij}>R_i+R_j$.
This can easily be shown by putting the interatomic potential between two hard spheres
$V(r_{ij})$
\begin{align}
    V(r_{ij})=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} \infty & 0<r_{ij} \leq R_i+R_j \\ 0  & r_{ij}> R_i+R_j \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
into the equation for the Mayer function
\begin{align}
     f(r_{ij})=\exp^{-\frac{V(r_{ij})}{k_{B}T}}-1
\end{align} 
%where

%
%The low-density excess free energy given by Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess}
%The lowest order term of the excess chemical potential  
%can then be written as a weighted density.
%\begin{align}
     %\mu_{excess}=k_BT\int n\theta(|\vec r|-2R)~d\vec r
      %%F_{excess}=k_BT\left(\int n^2\frac{\theta(|\vec r|-2R)}{2}~d\vec r\right) V
%\end{align} 
%where $n \rightarrow n(\vec r)$ for an inhomogeneous fluid.
%The excess Helmholtz free energy given in Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess} 
%can then be written as
%\begin{align}
      %F_{excess} = k_BTV\int n^2\frac{\theta(|\vec r|-2R)}{2}~d\vec r  
%\end{align} 
Rosenfeld recognized that the integral of the Heaviside step function
is equal to the volume of a sphere with a radius equal to that of the radii 
of two hard spheres added together. For a mixture of hard spheres of radius $R_i$ and $R_j$
this becomes
\begin{align}
       \int_{Volume} \Theta(r_{ij}-(R_i+R_j))~d\vec r_{ij} &=\frac{4\pi}{3}(R_i+R_j)^3  \label{exclusion-volume}\\
       &= \frac{4\pi}{3}R_i^3 + (4\pi R_i^2)R_j + R_i(4\pi R_j^2) + \frac{4\pi}{3}R_j^3  \nonumber \\
       &= V_i(1) + S_iR_j + R_iS_j+ V_j(1)  \label{VSR1sum}
\end{align}  
where the volume, surface area, radius, and the number 1 can be written as
\begin{align}
        V &= \int_{Volume} \Theta(r_{ij}-R)d\vec r_{ij} \\
        S &= \int_{Volume} \delta(r_{ij} -R) d\vec r_{ij}  \\
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}
        R &= \int_{Volume} \frac{\delta(r_{ij} -R)}{4\pi r_{ij}} d\vec r_{ij} \\
        1 &= \int_{Volume} \frac{\delta(r_{ij} -R)}{4\pi r_{ij}^2} d\vec r_{ij}    
\end{align}
where R is either $R_i$ or $R_j$ accordingly. Rosenfeld also recognized that the 
Heaviside function can be written as a convolution of the weight functions 
which, for a fluid composed only of spheres of radius R, is given by
\begin{align} \label{mayerconvolution}
    f(r_{ij})=-\Theta(r_{ij}-2R)= -2(w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1})
\end{align} 
where the scalar weights are given by
\begin{align} 
      w_3 &= \Theta(r_{ij}-R)  \label{scalar-weight3} 
\end{align} 
\begin{align} 
      w_2 &= \delta(r_{ij}-R) \\
      w_1 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi r_{ij}}  \\
      w_0 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi r_{ij}^2} \label{scalar-weight0}
\end{align}
and the two vector weights are
\begin{align}
      \vec {w}_2 &= w_2~\frac{\vec r_i-\vec r_j}{r_{ij}} \\
      \vec {w}_1 &= w_1~\frac{\vec r_i-\vec r_j}{r_{ij}}
\end{align}
which are needed for the relation in Equation~\ref{mayerconvolution} to be satisfied.

%Rewriting the first term V(1) in Equation~\ref{VSR1sum} gives
%\begin{align}

The convolution of two weight functions can be written as
\begin{align}
     w_\alpha\otimes w_\gamma(\vec r_i - \vec r_j) &= \int w_\alpha(\vec r') w_\gamma(\vec r_i -\vec r_j - \vec r') d\vec r'   \\                                                             
                                                   &= \int w_\alpha(\vec u - \vec r_j) w_\gamma(\vec r_i -\vec r_j -(\vec u - \vec r_j))d\vec u     \\                                                               
                                                   &= \int w_\alpha(\vec u - \vec r_j) w_\gamma(\vec r_i - \vec u) d\vec u  \\

For the scalar weights this is the same as
\begin{align} 
     w_\alpha\otimes w_\gamma(\vec r_i - \vec r_j) &= \int w_\gamma(\vec u - \vec r_i)w_\alpha(\vec u - \vec r_j)  d\vec u

and for the vector weights this becomes
\begin{align} 
     \vec w_\alpha\otimes \vec w_\gamma(\vec r_i - \vec r_j) &= -\int \vec {w}_\gamma(\vec u - \vec r_i)\cdot\vec {w}_\alpha(\vec u - \vec r_j)  d\vec u

%
%which can also be written as
%\begin{align}
     %\color{white}w_\alpha\otimes w_\gamma(\vec r_a - \vec r_b)\color{blue} &=\int w_\alpha(\vec x - \vec r_a) w_\gamma(\vec x - \vec r_b) d\vec x

\end{align}
The weighted densities $n_\alpha$ all depend on the spatially varying 
number density profile $n(\vec r)$, and have the form
\begin{align}
    n_\alpha(\vec r) &= \int n(\vec {r}~')w_\alpha(\vec r-\vec {r}~')~d\vec {r}~'  \label{weighted_densities}  \\

    %n_\alpha(\vec u)=\int n(\vec r')w_\alpha(\vec u-\vec r')~d\vec r'  
\end{align}  
and  $\vec n_1\cdot\vec n_2$=0 for the homogenesous case where $n(\vec r)\rightarrow n$.
%Equation~\ref{Fexlowden-inhomo} reduces to Equation~\ref{Fexlowden-homo}.
%The excess free energy in the low density limit then takes the form
%\begin{align}
%    F_{excess}=k_BT\left(\int n^2(\vec r)(w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1})~d\vec r\right)V
%\end{align}
%%which can now be expressed in terms of a set of weighted densities

%     F_{excess}=k_BT\left(\int n(\vec r)w_3 \otimes n(\vec r)w_0 + n(\vec r)w_2 \otimes n(\vec r)w_1 + n(\vec r)\vec{w_2} \otimes n(\vec r)\vec{w_1}~d\vec r\right)V
%\end{align}
%For a homogeneous fluid in the low density limit, the excess Helmholtz free
%energy can then be expressed as
%\begin{align}
      %F_{excess}=k_BTV\int n^2\frac{\theta(|\vec r|-2R)}{2}~d\vec r
%\end{align} 
%
%Rosenfeld arrived at an expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy 
%based on a set of weighted densities
%\begin{align}
    %F_{excess}=k_BT\int \Phi(\{n_i(\vec r)\})~d\vec r
%\end{align} 
%
%The resulting expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy which is
%applicable to the more general case of an inhomogeneous fluid, reduces 
%to the same result obtained from Scaled Particle Theory for a homogeneous 
%hard-sphere fluid. 
%

Lifting the restriction to the low density limit, Rosenfeld derived an
expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy by noting that the higher
order terms in the virial expansion can all be written in terms of an 
``exclusion volume" (given by Equation~\ref{exclusion-volume}), 
and an ``overlap volume" which is the volume of intersection between two 
overlapping spherical regions.
The exclusion volume is the spherical volume about the center of one sphere 
which the center of another sphere can not enter, and is used to describe
terms with $f_{ij}=f(|\vec r_i - \vec r_j|)$ as has been seen. Used in conjunction 
with the overlap volume, the higher order terms in the expansion
in Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}~\cite{rosenfeld1988} can be described. 
%
The resulting expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy with Tarazona's $\Phi_3$
(see Introduction) is given by
\begin{align}
    F_{excess}[n(\vec{r})] &= k_BT\int(\Phi_1(\vec{r})+\Phi_2(\vec{r})+\Phi_3(\vec{r}{)) d}\vec{r} \\
    %\Phi_1 &= -n_{0}ln(1-n_{3})  \\
    %\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_{1}n_{2}}{1-n_{3}} \\
    %\Phi_3 &= \frac{n_{2}^3}{24\pi(1-n_{3})^2}
    \Phi_1 &= -n_{0}\ln(1-n_{3}) \\
    \Phi_2 &= \frac{n_{1}n_{2}-\vec{n_{1}}\cdot\vec{n_{2}}}{1-n_{3}} \\
    \Phi_3 &= \frac{{n_2}^3-3n_2\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot\vec{n}_{v2}+\frac{9}{2}[\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot{\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}}\cdot{\vec{n}_{v2}}-\operatorname{Tr}({\overleftrightarrow{n}^3_{m2}})]}{24\pi(1-n_3)^2}  
\end{align}
%where in addition to the weight functions already defined,  
where the weighted densities are given by Equation~\ref{weighted_densities} with 
weight functions
\begin{align} 
      w_3 &= \Theta(r-R)  \label{scalar-weight3} \\
      w_2 &= \delta(r-R)  \\
      w_1 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi r}  \\
      w_0 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi r^2} \label{scalar-weight0}  \\
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}      
      \vec {w}_2 &= w_2~\hat r \\
      \vec {w}_1 &= w_1~\hat r \\
      \overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r}) &= w_2(r)\left(\frac{\vec{r}\vec{r}}{r^2}-\frac{I}{3}\right) 
\end{align}
%and a tensor weight function given by
%\begin{align}\label{eq:tensorweight-methods}
     %\overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r}) = w_2(r)\left(\frac{\vec{r}\vec{r}}{r^2}-\frac{I}{3}\right) 
%\end{align}
%The weighted densities $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, \vec{n}_1, \vec{n}_2$ and $\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}$
%all depend on the spatially varying number density profile $n(\vec r)$.
%\begin{align}%\label{eq:numdenprofile}
	%n_\alpha(\vec{r})=\int_{Volume}{n(\vec{r'})w_\alpha(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})d{\vec{r'}}}
%\end{align}
This result reduces to the same result obtained from Scaled Particle Theory 
for a homogeneous hard-sphere fluid.

The FMT equations shown so far have been for a hard-sphere fluid~\cite{Hansen}.
To model a fluid with ``soft" spheres which have an interatomic potential 
that decreases smoothly from infinity to zero over a distance of 2R rather than instanteously 
at 2R like that of hard spheres, Schmidt noted that 
all of the weight functions can be expressed in terms of 
$w_{2}(r)$ which, for a hard-sphere fluid, consists of a delta function.
He also noted that the derivative of the Mayer function 
%provides another important relation 
can be expressed in terms of $w_{2}(r)$, 
\begin{align}\label{mayerder=w2convolution}
     \frac{df(r)}{dr} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty{w_2(r')w_2(r-r')dr'}
\end{align} 
and that the weight function $w_{2}(r)$ is in turn related to $w_{3}(r)$ through 
the relation
\begin{align}\label{w2_w3_relation}
    w_{3}=\int_{r}^{\infty}{w_{2}(r)dr}\mbox{~~~~or equivalently,~~~~}-\frac{\partial{w_3(r)}}{\partial{r}}=w_2(r)
\end{align}
%which will be important to keep in tact when moving to SFMT~\cite{schmidt1999density}.
%Thus, all the weight functions, and the above relation are determined by $w_{3}(r)$.
Schmidt developed Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT) which extends FMT to fluids 
with soft potentials by keeping the relationships between the weight 
functions, and Equation~\ref{mayerder=w2convolution} 
%for the derivative of the Mayer function 
the same, but replacing $w_{3}(r)$ with a weight function appropriate 
for a soft-sphere potential~\cite{schmidt1999density, schmidt2000fluid}. 
This is what we do in forming a functional for the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson 
fluid as detailed in the next chapter on Methods.

%\textcolor{red}{TO HERE ----------------------------------}
%
%In order to apply classical Density Functional Theory to a system that has
%a fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles, a functional for 
%the Helmholtz free energy must first be formed. An expression for the ideal 
%portion of the Helmholtz free energy is given by Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal-n(r)}, 
%but forming an expression for the excess Helmholtz free
%energy from Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified} for the particular fluid 
%being modeled can be challenging. 
%Soft Fundamental Measure Theory (SFMT) is a method for forming an 
%expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy of a soft-sphere fluid
%that does not depend on explicitly taking into account the interaction 
%that each sphere with every other sphere in the fluid (as required by 
%Equation~\ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}). In the next chapter on methods, we
%will use an SFMT functional that we adapt to fit the soft-sphere WCA fluid.
%SFMT was developed by Schmidt~\cite{schmidt1999density, schmidt2000fluid} 
%for soft-spheres. It is an extension of Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) 
%originally developed by 
%Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989, rosenfeld1994, rosenfeld1996, fmtfromsptandsignerror} 
%for the hard-sphere fluid, and which expanded 
%Scaled Particle Theory (SPT)~\cite{santos2012phi3} 
%to inhomogeneous, or non-uniform hard-sphere fluids.

%in the excess Helmholtz free energy when one atom is added to an otherwise 
%closed system. He showed that the excess chemical potential is related to 
%the ensemble average of the Boltzman factor for the potential energy 
%difference $V_{diff}$ between a system with N atoms and one with N+1 atoms. 
%The resulting equation, shown below, is known as Widom's Insertion 
%Formula~\cite{Hansen}.
%\begin{align} \label{mu-der-int}
    %\mu_{ex}=\frac{F_{ex}(N+1)-F_{ex}(N)}{\Delta{N}}\bigg|_{T,V}
%\end{align}
%\begin{equation}\label{widoms-insertion-formula}{~}=-k_BT\ln\left(<e^{-\beta{V_{diff}}}>\right)\end{equation}
%where 
%\begin{align}
    %<e^{-\beta{V_{diff}}}>=\sum_s{P_se^{-\beta V_s}}
%\end{align}
%and
%\begin{align}
    %Z=\sum_s{e^{-\beta V_s}}
%\end{align}

%The quantity $<e^{-\beta{V_{diff}}}>$ can be evaluated by considering that
%there will be a change in the potential energy of $V_{diff}$ if one sphere
%is added, but no change in potential energy if no sphere is added ($V_{diff}=0$). 
%In this case, $P_s=\frac{e^{-\beta V_s}}{Z}$.
%%at each point in the fluid, there is a probability that 
%%a hard sphere of radius R has space available to exist at that point
%%without overlapping with other spheres, or it does not, as shown in 
%Widom's Insertion formula Equation~\ref{widoms-insertion-formula}, 
%then becomes~\cite{Hansen}
%\begin{align} 
	%\mu_{ex} &= -k_BT\ln\left(e^{-\beta{V_{diff}}}+1\right)  \\
	         %&= V_{diff} \\

    %\label{fig:p_overlap}
  %\end{figure}
%The quantity $<e^{-\beta{V_{diff}}}>$ can also be evaluated by considering
%that it takes no energy for a hard sphere to be placed at a point

%($V_{diff}=0$), but it would require infinite energy ($V_{diff}=\infty$)
%to place a sphere where it would overlap another sphere, as described 
%in Figure~\ref{fig:p_overlap}. 
%In this case Equation~\ref{widoms-insertion-formula} becomes~\cite{Hansen}
%\begin{align} \label{muexcess}
  %\mu_{excess}(R_{cavity}=R)=-k_BT\ln(1-n\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3) 
%\end{align}
%where the radius of the cavity $R_{cavity}$ equals the radius of a 
%hard sphere R, and $nV_{Sphere}$, which is equal to the total volume 
%occupied by the spheres divided by the total volume available, 
%is the probability that a sphere cannot be placed at some random
%point in the homogeneous fluid of number density, $n$, without
%overlapping with another sphere. $P_s$ would then have values of
%$nV_{Sphere}$ and $1-nV_{Sphere}$.

%\begin{align}
  %%W_{rev}(R_{cavity}=R)=-k_BT\ln(1-n\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3)
  %W_{rev}(R_{cavity}=R)=-k_BT\ln(1-\eta)

%where $\eta$ is the packing fraction defined as
%\begin{equation}{\eta = \frac{\mbox{Volume occupied by the spheres}}{\mbox{Total Volume}}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{\eta = \frac{N\frac{4}{3}\pi{R^3}}{V}}\end{equation}

%Scaled Particle Theory forms a more general result for the reversible work 
%as a function of the radius of the cavity by considering additional 
%cases where the cavity is larger, and much larger than the radius of 
%a hard sphere, and requiring continuity of the functions for the 
%different cases and their derivatives (first and second). 
%By setting the radius of the cavity to the hard sphere radius, the

%An expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy in terms of the

%by noticing that a quantity $G_{3}$ can be defined such that
%\begin{equation}{\eta =\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)\frac{4}{3}\pi{R^3}=nG_{3}}\end{equation}
%where $G_{3}$ is the volume of a sphere. 
%Likewise, by defining quantities
%\begin{equation}{G_{2}=4\pi{R^2}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{G_{1}=R}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{G_{0}=1}\end{equation}
%where $G_{2}$ is the surface area of a sphere, and $G_{1}$ is the

%\end{align}
%which has the form 
%\begin{align}
    %F_{excess} = k_BT(\Phi_1+\Phi_2+\Phi_3)V
%\end{align}
%%where 
%\begin{align}
   %\Phi_1 &= -n_{0}\ln(1-n_{3}) \label{Phi1equation} \\

   %\Phi_3 &= \frac{n_{2}^3}{24\pi(1-n_{3})^2}   \label{oldPhi3equation}
%\end{align}

%The quantities $n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}$ can be considered as weighted 
%densities where the weights are given by $G_{0},G_{1},G_{2},G_{3}$ respectively.
%\begin{align}
    %n_{i}=nG_{i}
%\end{align}
%These weights are valid for determining the excess free energy of a system of 
%hard spheres with a homogeneous number density n. But these weights, and 
%their related  weighted densities, can be written in a more general form 
%allowing for their extension to a system with a spatially varying number 
%density $n(\vec{r})$, that is, an inhomogeneous fluid, in which case, the
%excess Helmholtz free energy is written as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:F_ex-n-of-r}{F_{excess}[n(\vec{r})]= k_BT\int(\Phi_1(\vec{r})+\Phi_2(\vec{r})+\Phi_3(\vec{r}{)) d}\vec{r}}\end{equation} 
%Using a backwards Heaviside step function defined as
%\begin{equation}{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-R)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} 1 & 0<r \leq R \\ 0  & r>R \end{array}\right.}\end{equation}
%the following expressions are obtained
%\begin{equation}{G_{3}=\int_{Volume}{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-R)d{\vec{r}}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi{R^3}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{G_{2}=\int_{Volume}{\delta(|\vec{r}|-R)d{\vec{r}}} = 4\pi{R^2}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{G_{1}=\int_{Volume}{\frac{\delta(|\vec{r}|-R)}{r}d{\vec{r}}} = R}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}{G_{0}=\int_{Volume}{\frac{\delta(|\vec{r}|-R)}{r^2}d{\vec{r}}} = 1}\end{equation}
%where the weighted densities can now be expressed as
%\begin{align}
    %n_{i}=\int_{Volume}{nw_{i}(r)}d{\vec{r}}
%\end{align} 
%or for a spatially varying number density $n(\vec{r})$,
%\begin{equation}\label{weighted-density}{n_i(\vec{r})=\int_{Volume}{n(\vec{r'})w_i(|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|)d{\vec{r'}}}}\end{equation}
%with weight functions
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w3}{w_{3}=\Theta(|\vec{r}|-R)}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w2}{w_{2}=\delta(|\vec{r}|-R)}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w1}{w_{1}=\frac{w_{2}}{4\pi{r}}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w0}{w_{0}=\frac{w_{2}}{4\pi{r}^2}}\end{equation}

%The weight functions $w_{2}$ and $w_{3}$ have the relation
%\begin{equation}\label{w2_w3_relation}{w_{3}=\int_{r}^{\infty}{w_{2}(\vec{r})dr}\mbox{~~~~or equivalently,~~~~}-\frac{\partial{w_3(r)}}{\partial{r}}=w_2(r)}\end{equation}
%which will be important to keep in tact when moving to SFMT~\cite{schmidt1999density}.

%The weight functions can be related to the Mayer function 
%\begin{align}
     %f(r)=\exp^{-\frac{V(r)}{k_{B}T}}-1
%\end{align} 
%where r is the distance between the centers of two hard spheres, and 
%$V(r)$ is the interatomic potential between two hard spheres given by 
%\begin{align}
    %V(r)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} \infty & 0<r \leq 2R \\ 0  & r>2R \end{array}\right.
%\end{align}
%Evaluating Equation with $V(r)$ given by Equation,  
%the Mayer function for a hard-sphere fluid is found to be
%\begin{equation}\label{f(r)step}{f(r)=-\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)}\end{equation} 
%which can be written in terms of the weight functions if two 
%additional vector weight functions $\vec{w_2}$ and $\vec{w_1}$ are introduced
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w_v2}{\vec{w_{2}}=w_{2}\frac{\vec{r}}{r}}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w_v1}{\vec{w_{1}}=w_{1}\frac{\vec{r}}{r}}\end{equation} 
%The Mayer function can then be written in terms of the weight functions~\cite{Hansen}
%\begin{equation}\label{mayer_deconvolution}{f(r)=-\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)= -2(w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1})}\end{equation}  

%Taking the derivative of the Mayer function in Eq~\ref{f(r)step} provides 
%another relation that will be important to keep in tact when moving to 
%SFMT~\cite{schmidt2000fluid}.
%\begin{align}\label{mayerder=w2convolution}
     %\frac{df(r)}{dr} = w_2 \otimes w_2 = \int{w_2(r')w_2(r-r')dr'}
%\end{align} 
%This relation can easily be checked for a hard-sphere fluid where
%\begin{equation}{\frac{df(r)}{dr}=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} \frac{d}{dr}(-1)=0 & r<2R \\\frac{d}{dr}(\text{vertical line})=+\infty & r=2R \\ \frac{d}{dr}(0)=0  & r>2R \end{array}\right.}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{mayerder}{\frac{df(r)}{dr} = \delta(r-2R)}\end{equation} 
%The right side can be evaluated by using the general relation for 
%convolution which is equal to the Inverse Fourier Transform 
%of a product of Fourier Transforms. 
%\begin{equation}{f \otimes g = \text{I.F.T.[ F.T.}[f]\text{ x F.T.[g] }]}\end{equation} 
%Taking the Fourier Transform of the weight function $w_2(r)=\delta(r-R)$ 
%gives
%\begin{equation}{\text{F.T.}[w_2]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(r-R)e^{-ikr}dr=e^{-ikR}}\end{equation} 
%and the right side of Equation~\ref{mayerder=w2convolution} becomes
%\begin{equation}{w_2 \otimes w_2 = \text{I.F.T.}[e^{-ikR}e^{-ikR}]}\end{equation} 
%\begin{equation}\label{w2convolution}{=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-ik2R}e^{ikr}dk=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{ik(r-2R)}dk=\delta(r-2R)}\end{equation} 
%which matches Equation~\ref{mayerder}.

%Tarazona later improved upon the original FMT equations by replacing the
%expression for $\Phi_3$ given by Equation~\ref{oldPhi3equation} with the
%more accurate expression~\cite{tarazonaphi3, santos2012phi3} 
%\begin{align}
%\Phi_3 &= \frac{{n_2}^3-3n_2\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot\vec{n}_{v2}+\frac{9}{2}[\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot{\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}}\cdot{\vec{n}_{v2}}-\operatorname{Tr}({\overleftrightarrow{n}^3_{m2}})]}{24\pi(1-n_3)^2}  \label{eq:Phi3}
%\end{align}
%in which a tensor weight is incorporated given by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:tensorweight}{\overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r})=w_2(r)\left(\frac{\vec{r}\vec{r}}{r^2}-\frac{I}{3}\right)}\end{equation} 
%%All the other FMT equations remain the same. 

%The FMT equations shown so far have been for a hard-sphere fluid~\cite{Hansen}.
%All of the weight functions, the relations between them, and the equation 
%for the derivative of the Mayer function, can be expressed in terms of 
%$w_{2}(r)$ which, for a hard-sphere fluid, consists of a delta function.
%The weight function $w_{2}(r)$ is in turn related to $w_{3}(r)$ through 
%Equation~\ref{w2_w3_relation}.
%Soft Fundamental Measure Theory extends FMT discussed so far to fluids 
%with soft potentials by keeping the relationships between the weight 
%functions, and the equation for the derivative of the Mayer function 
%the same (Equations~\ref{eq:w0},~\ref{eq:w1},~\ref{eq:w_v1},~\ref{eq:w_v2},
%~\ref{w2_w3_relation},~\ref{eq:tensorweight},~\ref{mayerder=w2convolution}), 
%but replacing $w_{3}(r)$ with a weight function appropriate 
%for a soft-sphere potential~\cite{schmidt1999density, schmidt2000fluid}. 
%This is what we do in forming a functional for the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson 
%fluid as detailed in the next chapter on Methods.

\section{The Overall Approach}
  
Our goal is to generate temperature-density and pressure-temperature 
phase diagrams for a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson model fluid. 
A temperature-density phase diagram for a fluid that does not
have attraction between the particles that make up the fluid will show
two distinct regions - a fluid region at lower densities, and a solid 
region at higher densities. 
A phase transition between a fluid and a solid is accompanied by an 
abrupt change in the number density, and so there is a gap between the 
purely fluid and the purely solid regions. Within the gap, or coexistence
region, is found mixtures of various amounts of fluid and solid each of
which have number densities that are fixed at the values they had at the 
phase transition. 
To construct the phase diagram, the fluid and solid phase transition 
number densities are found 
%Maxwell's double tangent construction can be used to find 
%these number densities given plots of 
from the fluid and the solid Helmholtz 
free energies and inverse densities at a given temperature, as
discussed in Section 2.2. 

We use classical Density Functional Theory 
to find the Helmholtz free energies of the fluid and the solid. 
A functional for the ideal portion of the
Helmholtz free energy is given by Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal-n(r)}, and a 
functional for 
the excess Helmholtz free energy, which depends on the interatomic potential
between particles, will be developed in the next section using SFMT. 
Once a functional is constructed, the Helmholtz free energy can be found - 
but not directly. The equilibrium number density profile must first be 
identified. According to cDFT, the equilibrium number density profile, 
and its corresponding equilibrium Helmholtz free energy can be found 
by trying many different number densities, and identifying the one that 
minimizes the Helmholtz free energy. In this section, we look at how to 
generate various number density profiles that can be used to implement cDFT. 

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{PrimitiveCellLightBlue.png}
  \caption{A primitive crystal cell is shown by the shaded parallelepiped.}
  \label{fig:primitivecell}
\end{figure}

It is known that a fluid with a soft potential like the WCA fluid will 
form a Face Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal in its solid state~\cite{Hansen}. 
Although an entire 
crystal lattice can be constructed with FCC cells, 
they are not the smallest cells with which the lattice can be built. 
The shaded parallelepiped shown within the FCC cell in Figure \ref{fig:primitivecell} 
is the smallest structure that, when repeated, re-creates the entire crystal 
lattice. This parallelepiped primitive cell takes up one-fourth the volume 
of an FCC cell, and contains the equivalent of one atom.
It includes portions of eight atoms each located on a lattice site conveniently 
reachable by moving along one of three different lattice vectors. 
The three lattice vectors will be useful in 
creating the lattice structure computationally, and will also make our 
program run faster.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{Ensemble_Gaussian.png}
  \caption{On the left are shown four examples of possible positions 
  that an atom (blue sphere) might have within a cell that has one 
  lattice site (black dot) at the center. A large number of such 
  possibilities would give rise to a Gaussian distribution, 
  as shown on the right.}
  \label{fig:Ensemble_Gaus}
\end{figure} 

An atom will not realistically reside exactly at a lattice point. 
Statistically there will typically be a normal, or Gaussian distribution 
of positions about the lattice point. 
Atoms are always in motion, so when talking about ``the location" 
of an atom, we are talking about a time averaged position, so that it 
does not change with time.
Figure \ref{fig:Ensemble_Gaus} shows examples 
of four possible positions an atom (shown in blue) might have in a crystal 
cell that has one lattice site at its center (represented by a black dot). 
The atom is slightly off the lattice site in each example, and 
a sampling of many possibilities - more than just the four given 
as examples - would create an average distribution profile that looks 
like a Gaussian distribution, as shown on the right.
A plot of a Gaussian distribution in 2-dimensions is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:Gaus_plot} where the width of the Gaussian is described 
by $\sigma$ (not to be confused with the $\sigma$ related to the 
Lennard-Jones model). 
Three-dimensional Gaussian distributions centered at lattice points can be 
used to represent a number density profile $n(\vec{r})$  which describes 
how the atoms are distributed on average over a collection of cells. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=6cm]{Gaussian}
  \caption{A 2D Gaussian Distribution of width 2$\sigma$}
  \label{fig:Gaus_plot}
\end{figure}  
  
There can be many different number density profiles for a given number
density. The number density is the number of atoms per volume, whereas
the number density profile describes how much ``atom" will be found at various 
points in the cell. 
It can be thought of as an average over a large collection of actual cells
with various possible spatial distributions of the atoms within the cell, or
more precisely, as an ensemble average over all possible microstates, 
each of which consists of a unique set of positions for the atoms 
that occupy the cell. Mathematically, the microstates are represented 
by a set of delta functions.
\begin{align}
    n(\vec r)=~\left<\sum_{i=1}^N\delta(\vec r - \vec r_i)\right>
\end{align} 
By varying the width of the Gaussian distributions, a number of different 
number density profiles can be generated for a given number density.
It is important to note that the number density does not change when 
introducing a number density profile.  
There are still the same number of atoms over some fixed volume. 
Taking the average of the number density profile over some volume 
gives the number density. 
\begin{align}
    n=\left<n(\vec{r})\right>=\frac{1}{V}\int{n(\vec{r})}{d\vec{r}}=\frac{N}{V}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{Ensemble_Smallcells.png}
   \caption{On the left are shown four examples of possible positions 
   that an atom (blue sphere) might have within a volume 
   containing eight cells. Each cell has one lattice site at the center 
   represented by a black dot. A large number of such possibilities 
   would give rise to the Gaussian distributions shown on the right.}
   \label{fig:Ensemble_Smallcells}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{SameStatPic.png}
   \caption{Front views of a cube with eight smaller cells. The two views 
   show two ways of picturing a fraction of vacancies, $f_v$ of 7/8 which 
   give rise to the same Gaussian distribution statistically, 
   and the same number density. In reality, the fraction of vacancies will
   be very small.}
   \label{fig:SameStatPic}
\end{figure} 

There is another way to generate different number density profiles for 
a given number density besides changing the width of the Gaussians. 
It may be that not all lattice sites are occupied. Vacancies can be taken 
into account while keeping the overall number density the same by 
making the cells smaller. A large collection of smaller cells creates a 
new number density profile shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Ensemble_Smallcells} 
with eight smaller Gaussians each of which is now one-eighth the height. 
Instead of thinking of an atom in one of the eight small cells, the same 
Gaussian distribution can be obtained from thinking of one-eighth of an 
atom in each small cell as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SameStatPic}.  
The number of particles within a primitive cell is then given by  
\begin{align}
    N= (1-f_v){N_{no.vacancies}}
\end{align} 

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=8cm]{VaryWidthandVacancies.png}

   profiles $n(\vec r)$ all with the same number density, n.}

   \includegraphics[height=4cm]{figs/homogeneous_bold-box.pdf}
   \caption{A homogeneous number density profile $n(\vec{r})$.}
   \label{fig:homogen_denisty}
\end{figure} 

To implement classical Density Functional Theory, 
a set of number density profiles is generated by varying the Gaussian width 
and the fraction of vacancies at a given combination of temperature and 
number density, as shown by the example in Figure~\ref{fig:Ensemble_vary}.
A homogeneous number density profile is used for a fluid, as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:homogen_denisty}.
Once again, it is important to note that the number density is the same 
for all these number density profiles $n(\vec{r})$.  
The Helmholtz free energy $F[n(\vec{r})]$ is calculated for each number 
density profile in the set, and also for the homogeneous number density profile 
characteristic of a fluid. Both the ideal and excess free energies are 
found, and added together to get the total Helmholtz free energy.
According to cDFT, the actual equilibrium Helmholtz free energy at
the given temperature and number density will be the one
that corresponds to the number density profile that minimizes the functional. 
This process is repeated to find the free energies at other combinations 
of temperatures and number densities. 

Once the Helmholtz free energy for both the crystal and fluid 
are found for a given temperature and density, they can be 
used to construct phase diagrams.
Outside the region of coexistence, a purely crystalline state will exist 
if the crystal free energy is lower than the fluid free energy, and 
a purely fluid state will exist if the fluid free energy is lower than 
the crystal free energy. 
After the actual number densities of the crystal and fluid states
at the boundaries of the coexistence region are determined for a given 
temperature, phase diagrams can be constructed as described in Section 2.2.

\section{Our Functional for the Excess Helmholtz free energy}
In order to apply classical Density Functional Theory, an expression 
for the Helmholtz free energy as a functional of a number density profile 
must be found. Computing the ideal portion of the 
Helmholtz free energy is straightforward, but computing the excess portion 
of the Helmholtz free energy is difficult since it depends on the interatomic 
potential energy $V(r)$ that exists between each sphere and all the other spheres, 
as is shown by Equations~\ref{eq:mayerfunction} and \ref{eq:Fexcess-simplified}.
Soft Fundamental Measure Theory is a method
developed to form an expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy without
explicitly taking into account the interaction of each sphere with all the others, 
but it must be tailored to fit a particular fluid\cite{schmidt1999density}.  

Our SFMT functional is tailored to fit a WCA fluid, and 
is written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:Fexfunctional}
  F_{excess}[n(\vec{r})]=k_BT\int(\Phi_1(\vec{r})+\Phi_2(\vec{r})+\Phi_3(\vec{r}{)) d}\vec{r}
\end{align}
%where 
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_{0}\ln(1-n_{3}) \\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_{1}n_{2}-\vec{n_{1}}\cdot\vec{n_{2}}}{1-n_{3}} \\
\Phi_3 &= \frac{{n_2}^3-3n_2\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot\vec{n}_{v2}+\frac{9}{2}[\vec{n}_{v2}\cdot{\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}}\cdot{\vec{n}_{v2}}-\operatorname{Tr}({\overleftrightarrow{n}^3_{m2}})]}{24\pi(1-n_3)^2}  
\end{align} 
The weighted densities $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, \vec {n}_1, \vec {n}_2$ and $\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}$ are found from
\begin{align}\label{eq:numdenprofile}
	n_\alpha(\vec{r})=\int_{Volume}{n(\vec{r'})w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|)d{\vec{r'}}}
\end{align}
where the number density profile $n(\vec r)$ within the integral is given 
by Gaussian functions centered at each lattice point.
There are four scalar weight functions given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:weights}
  w_{0}(r) &=\frac{w_{2}}{4\pi{r}^2} \\
  w_{1}(r) &=\frac{w_{2}}{4\pi{r}} \\
  w_2(r) &=-\frac{\partial{w_3(r)}}{\partial{r}} \\
  &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\Xi\sqrt\pi}\exp^{-\left(\frac{r-\frac{\alpha}{2}}{\Xi/\sqrt{2}}\right)^2}  \\
  w_3(r) &=\frac{1}{2}\left[1-\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\frac{\alpha}{2}}{\frac{\Xi}{\sqrt{2}}}\right)\right]  
\end{align}
two vector weight functions given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:w_v2}{  \vec{w_{2}}=w_{2}\frac{\vec{r}}{r}  }\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:w_v1}{  \vec{w_{1}}=w_{1}\frac{\vec{r}}{r}  }\end{equation} 
and one tensor weight function which is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tensorweight-methods}\overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r}) = w_2(r)\left(\frac{\vec{r}\vec{r}}{r^2}-\frac{I}{3}\right)\end{equation}
All of the weight functions depend on the expression for $w_3(r)$ 
which in turn depends on the interatomic potential $V(r)$ that exists 
between the spheres, and which defines the particular fluid being modeled.

The weight functions $w_{2}(r)$ and $w_{3}(r)$ are constructed using 
Schmidt's proposed error function model~\cite{schmidt2000fluid} designed 
to model a steep, soft potential in which he set
\begin{equation}{w_3(r)=\frac{1}{2}}\left[1-\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\frac{\sigma}{2}}{\frac{\text{a}}{\sqrt{2}}}\right)\right]\end{equation} 
subject to the boundary conditions $w_3(0)\approx{1}$ 
and $w_3(\infty)=0$. 
Our functional is  created by replacing Schmidt's parameters $\sigma$ 
and $a$ with our temperature dependent parameters $\alpha$ and $\Xi$.
%The two parameters $\alpha$ and $\Xi$ make the temperature-dependent error 
%function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ approximate, in the region of interest, 
%the temperature-independent WCA potential which is difficult 
%to implement computationally. 
The two parameters $\alpha$ and $\Xi$ are designed to make the functional
produce results which approximate, in the region of interest, that of  
a WCA fluid using the temperature-dependent error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ 
instead of the temperature-independent WCA potential which is difficult 
to implement computationally. 
%$\Xi(T)$ is determined by setting the second virial coefficient $B_2$ of 
%the error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ equal to that of the
%WCA potential, $B_{2erf}(T)=B_{2wca}(T)$ for a given temperature.  
The error function potential emerges from $w_{3}(r)$, and the relationships 
in Equations~\ref{w2_w3_relation} and~\ref{mayerder=w2convolution}.
Using Equation~\ref{w2_w3_relation}(repeated below),
\begin{displaymath}
     w_{3}=\int_{r}^{\infty}{w_{2}(\vec{r})dr}\mbox{~~~~or equivalently,~~~~}-\frac{\partial{w_3(r)}}{\partial{r}}=w_2(r)
\end{displaymath}
and solving for $w_2(r)$
\begin{align}{\frac{dw_3(r)}{dr}\bigg|_{\infty}-\frac{dw_3(r)}{dr}\bigg|_{r}=w_2(r)}\end{align} 
we get \begin{equation}{ w_2(r)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\Xi\sqrt\pi}\exp^{-\left(\frac{r-\frac{\alpha}{2}}{\Xi/\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} }\end{equation} 
Putting $w_2(r)$ into Equation~\ref{mayerder=w2convolution}, shown again below, 
\begin{displaymath}
    \frac{df(r)}{dr}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{w_2(r')w_2(r-r')dr'}
\end{displaymath}
gives
\begin{equation}{\frac{df(r)}{dr}=\frac{1}{\Xi\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}}\end{equation} 
which can be integrated to obtain the Mayer function
\begin{equation}{f(r)=\int_{\infty}^r{ \frac{1}{\Xi\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\left(\frac{r'-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}{dr'}}}\end{equation} 
The Mayer function for the error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ is thus 
given by
\begin{align}  \label{eq:VerfMayerfunction}
     f(r)=-\frac{1}{2}\left[1-\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)\right]
\end{align} 
Combining this result with the definition of the Mayer function 
\begin{align}f(r)=e^{-\frac{V(r)}{K_BT}}-1\end{align} 
gives an expression for the for the error function potential  $V(r)=V_{erf}(r)$ 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Verf}
	V_{erf}(r)=-k_BT\ln\left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)+1\right)\right]
\end{equation}  
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=7cm]{plot_alpha.pdf}
  \caption{Shows the temperature dependence of $\alpha$ vs $k_BT$ 
  for $\sigma=1$ and $\epsilon=1$.}
  \label{fig:alphaXivsT}
\end{figure}
Unlike physical potential energies, the error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ is temperature dependent.
We construct temperature-dependent parameters $\alpha$ and $\Xi$ 
to model a WCA potential. 
The parameter $\alpha(T)$ is derived by setting the error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ 
equal to the WCA potential given by Equation~\ref{eq:VWCA} at $r=\alpha$, since 
the derivative of the Mayer function peaks at this value. 
\begin{align}
    V_{erf}(\alpha)=V_{WCA}(\alpha)
\end{align}
This gives
\begin{equation}\label{alphaT}\alpha(T)=\sigma\left(\frac{2}{1+\sqrt{\frac{k_BT}{\epsilon}\ln(2)}}\right)^\frac{1}{6}\end{equation} 
Figure \ref{fig:alphaXivsT} shows how $\alpha(T)$ varies with temperature 
when $\sigma=1$ and $\epsilon=1$.    

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=7cm]{xi_fromB2.pdf}
  \caption{Shows the temperature dependence of $\Xi$ generated from 
  matching the second virial coefficients for $V_{\operatorname{erf}}(r)$ and $V_{WCA}(r)$ 
  at each temperature.}
  \label{fig:xi_fromB2vsT}
\end{figure}

We determine the value of $\Xi(T)$ at a given temperature $T$,
by setting the second virial coefficient evaluated for the error 
function potential $V_{\operatorname{erf}}(r)$ equal to the second virial 
coefficient evaluated for the WCA potential $V_{WCA}(r)$.
\begin{equation}B_{2\operatorname{erf}}(T) =B_{2WCA}(T)\end{equation}
The second virial coefficient is given by
\begin{equation}B_2=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{Volume}f(\vec{r})d\vec r\end{equation}
Using the Mayer function for the error function potential given by 
Equation~\ref{eq:VerfMayerfunction} we found (see Appendix) the second 
virial coefficient $B_{2}$ for the error function potential $V_{erf}(r)$ 
to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:B2erf}
	B_{2\operatorname{erf}}(T) = \frac{\pi}{3}\Xi^3\left[\left(\frac{\alpha^3}{\Xi^3}+\frac{3\alpha}{2\Xi}\right)\left(1+\operatorname{\operatorname{erf}}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)\right)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{\Xi^2}+1\right)e^{-\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}\right]
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(T)$ is given by Equation~\ref{alphaT}. Similarly, 
$B_{2WCA}$ can be found computationally from 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:B2wca}
	B_{2WCA}=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{Volume}\left(e^{-\beta{V}_{WCA}(r)}-1\right)d\vec{r} 
\end{equation}
The parameter $\Xi(T)$ is found to be the value that makes Equations~\ref{eq:B2erf} 
and \ref{eq:B2wca} equal each other for a given temperature T. 
A plot of $\Xi(T)$ obtained through this method is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:xi_fromB2vsT}.

Figure \ref{fig:weight_functions} shows a one dimensional view of the 
weight functions $w_0$, $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ as they vary with distance 
along the z-axis. In three dimensions, the weighting functions 
$w_0$, $w_1$, $w_2$ are spherical shells, 
and $w_3$ is a solid sphere with an edge that tapers off.
$\Xi$ is related to the width of the weight functions which 
become thicker, or taper off longer as the temperature increases, and 
$\alpha$ is related to the radius of the shell, or sphere, and decreases 
as the temperature increases.

\section{Computing the Fluid and Crystal Helmholtz free energies}
The Helmholtz free energy is composed of two parts: an ideal Helmholtz free energy 
and an excess Helmholtz free energy that are added together to get the total
Helmholtz free energy, $F=F_{ideal} + F_{excess}$. 
And so the ideal and excess Helmholtz free energies
must be computed for both the fluid and the crystal states.
The fluid ideal Helmholtz free energy is computed analytically 
using Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal} for a given homogeneous reduced 
(or dimensionless) number density $n^*$ and temperature $t^*$. 
The crystal ideal Helmholtz free energy is computed computationally 
from Equation~\ref{eq:Fideal-n(r)} with the varying number density profile given by
\begin{align}
  n(|\vec{r}-\vec{R_j}|)=\sum_j{(1-f_v)\frac{e^{-\frac{{|\vec{r}-\vec{R_j}|}^2}{2{\sigma}^2}}}{\left(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma\right)^3}}
\end{align}
where $\vec R_j$ is the position vector of the jth lattice site.

%\end{figure} 

The fluid excess Helmholtz free energy is computed analytically  
using SFMT Equations~\ref{eq:Fexfunctional} through \ref{eq:tensorweight-methods} 
with a uniform number density profile, $n$ that does not depend on $\vec r$. 
The crystal excess Helmholtz free energy is computed  
using SFMT with a number density profile 
that consists of Gaussian distributions 
centered at lattice sites specified by position vectors $\vec R$. 
The weight functions $w_\alpha(|\vec r - \vec r~'|)$ are centered at $\vec r'$,
as shown for $w_2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:GaussandW2_actual}a. 
But because the weight function is a function of the magnitude of the 
difference between $\vec r$ and $\vec r~'$, it can be thought of as 
centered at $\vec r$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GaussandW2_actual}b.
Keeping the weight function centered at $\vec r$, 
Monte-Carlo integration can be used to compute the weighted densities $n_\alpha(\vec r)$
by randomly generating vectors
$\vec r~' -\vec R$ according to a Gaussian distribution.
%
%ERRORS IN HERE... 
%Only lengths for $\vec r~'- \vec R$ that are within an inclusion radius
%about a lattice site, like that shown in Figure \ref{fig:InclusionRadius}, 
%will be taken into account as Gaussians 
%farther away will not contribute much.
%The equation for the contribution to the weighted density from a 
%Gaussian centered at the jth lattice site located at $\vec R_j$ is given by
%\begin{equation}{n_\alpha(\vec r)= \int_{r'}{(1-f_v)n(\vec r~' - \vec R_j)w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)} {d}\vec{r}~'}\end{equation} 
%and is implemented computationally in the form
%\begin{equation}{n_\alpha(\vec r)= \sum_{r'}{(1-f_v)n(\vec r~' -\vec R_j)w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)dV}}\end{equation} 
%which can be written as
%\begin{equation}{n_\alpha(\vec r)= \sum_{NumPoints}(1-f_v)P_{r'}w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)}\end{equation} 
%NumPoints is the number of vectors $\vec r~' - \vec R_j$ randomly 
%generated about the jth lattice site, and $n(\vec r~' - \vec R_j)$
%is equal to a probability density which when multiplied by dV gives 
%the probability $P_{r'}$ at which the value of $w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)$ 
%will occur. Using the relation
%\begin{equation}{f_{average}=\sum_i^N{P_if_i}=\sum_i{\frac{f_i}{N}}}\end{equation} 
%$n_\alpha(\vec{r})$ can be expressed as the average value of $(1-f_v)w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)$:
%\begin{equation}{n_\alpha(\vec{r})=\sum_{\text{NumPoints}}\frac{(1-f_v)w_\alpha(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}~'|)}{\text{NumPoints}}}\end{equation}
%This process is repeated to get the contributions to the weighted density 
%$n_\alpha(\vec r)$ from the Gaussians around each lattice point which begin to 
%merge together as the width of the Gaussians increases.
%All the contributions are then added together 
%to get the final value of the weighted density at some point $\vec r$.

%The result can be made more accurate by increasing NumPoints (the

%To use antithetic variates, each randomly generated  vector is paired 
%with a vector of equal magnitude, but opposite in direction. 
%First order error is reduced by averaging the two results that depend on 
%the vectors, one of which may be erroneously higher than it should be 
%while the other is erroneously lower than it should be.

%The standard error of the mean (SEM) is given in general by
%\begin{equation}{SD_{mean}=\frac{SD}{\sqrt{N}}}\end{equation} 
%To compute the error, the standard deviation of weight function $w_3$ is used

%\begin{equation}{Error=\sqrt{\frac{\overline{w_3^2}-(\overline{w}_3)^2}{\text{NumPoints}}}}\end{equation} 
%NumPoints, the number of vectors randomly generated, is increased until

\chapter{Results and Discussion}

Phase diagrams for the WCA fluid are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:Phase_Diagram_of_T_vs_n} 
and \ref{fig:Phase_Diagram_P_vs_T}. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:Phase_Diagram_of_T_vs_n} the reduced temperature 
$T^*\equiv\frac{kT}{\epsilon}$ is plotted against the reduced number density 
$n^*\equiv n\sigma^3$ for temperatures of $T^*$ = 0.5 to 3.0. 
%In all cases $\sigma=1$ and $\epsilon=1$. 
It is seen that in general, a fluid exists at lower number densities, 
and a solid exists at higher number densities. 
For a given temperature, it is seen that as the density increases, 
a maximum number density is reached for the fluid. 
Looking at the coexistence region as a whole for all temperatures, 
it is seen to extend over a narrow range of number densities which 
gradually shifts towards higher densities as the temperature increases. 
This is expected since at higher temperatures the fluid would have to 
be under greater compression before forming a solid. 

White lines superimposed on the phase diagram show the boundaries of the 
coexistence region as predicted by Monte-Carlo simulations~\cite{May} 
of the WCA fluid. 
Overall, the general shape, and position of the two coexistence regions 
correspond fairly closely, but the Monte-Carlo region is a little wider
and shifted a bit toward smaller densities. For example, at a temperature 
of $T^*$=1, the cDFT fluid transition reduced number density is 0.96, 
and the solid transition reduced number density is 1.02, giving a spread 
of 0.06, whereas the Monte-Carlo results give a fluid transition 
reduced number density of 0.92, and a solid transition reduced number 
density of 1.00, giving a spread of 0.08.

  density for the WCA fluid. The red region is fluid, and the blue region is

  is the region of coexistence where some fluid and solid exist together 
  in varying proportions. White lines show the boundaries of the coexistence 
  region generated from Monte-Carlo simulations.}
  \label{fig:Phase_Diagram_of_T_vs_n}
\end{figure}

%The solid phase transition number densities predicted by each method 
%are very nearly the same along all temperatures, but the fluid phase 
%transition number densities predicted by cDFT are notably higher than 
%those predicted by the Monte-Carlo simulations, making the width of the 
%Monte-Carlo region about one-third larger for most temperatures above KT=1. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:Phase_Diagram_of_T_vs_n_AS} shows our results for a wider 
%range of reduced temperatures from kT=0.5 to 38. The white lines show the results
%of molecular simulations of the WCA fluid made by Ahmed and Sadus~\cite{ahmedsadus}.
%As can be seen in the figure, the region of coexistence in our simulations 
%falls within the region of coexistence predicted by Ahmed and Sadus at almost 
%all temperatures from approximately kT=0.5 to 28. At the low temperature of kT=0.5,
%the width of the coexistence regions are nearly the same, while moving to 
%higher temperatures,the width of our coexistence region ranges from about 
%one-half to one-forth the size. Although, our coexistence region is only 
%about one-forth the size at kT=28, it is centered within the coexistence 
%region predicted by Ahmed and Sadus.

Figure~\ref{fig:Phase_Diagram_P_vs_T} shows the reduced pressure 
$p^*\equiv\frac{P\sigma^3}{\epsilon}$ plotted against the reduced temperature 
for temperatures of $T^*$ = 0.5 to 3.0. 
The black line marks the phase boundary between the solid and fluid regions. 
It is seen that the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure must be
to undergo a phase transition from a fluid to a solid, as would be expected. 
Ideally, the slope of the phase boundary $\frac{dP}{dT}$ at some point (P,T) 
is given by
\begin{align} 
    \frac{dP}{dT}=\frac{S_f-S_s}{V_f-V_s}
\end{align}
Since the entropy and the volume of the fluid is greater than the entropy
and the volume of the solid, the slope should be positive. 

Comparing the slope of the phase boundary predicted by cDFT to that
from Monte-Carlo simulations shown by the white line, it is seen that
the phase transition pressures predicted by cDFT 
are consistently higher, and the 
discrepancy grows as the pressure increases. For example, at a 
temperature of $T^*$=1, the phase transition reduced pressure predicted by 
cDFT is 15.24, whereas the Monte-Carlo simulation predicted a reduced 
pressure of 9.99,
and at a temperature of $T^*$=3, cDFT gives a value of 77.27 whereas the 
Monte-Carlo simulation predicts 43.80.
This may indicate that either the difference between the fluid 
and solid phase transition entropies predicted by cDFT is too high, or 
the difference in the volumes is too low.

\chapter{Conclusion}
We were successful in predicting the freezing of a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson 
fluid using classical Density Functional Theory. To construct a Helmholtz 
free energy functional $F[n(r)]$, we used SFMT with Schmidt's error 
function model, and defined two temperature dependent parameters, $\alpha$ 
and $\Xi$, to model a WCA fluid. 
$\alpha$ was found by setting the error function potential equal to the 
WCA potential at $r=\alpha$, and $\Xi$ was found for each temperature by 
setting the second virial coefficients for the error function potential 
and the WCA potential equal to each other, $B_{2erf}(T)=B_{2wca}(T)$ 
at each temperature.
To implement cDFT we used Gaussian distribution functions centered at 
lattice points to represent the number density profile which was then varied
by changing the width of the Gaussians, and the fraction of vacant lattice
sites until the Helmholtz free energy was minimized. Once the equilibrium 
Helmholtz free energy for the fluid and solid states were found for a given
temperature and number density, 
we used this data 
to find the number densities of the fluid and the solid at the phase transition.
Using this information, we generated a temperature-density 
phase diagram that yielded coexistence regions that approximately 
matched the Monte-Carlo
% and molecular simulation 
results, though shifted a bit toward higher densities. 
%for values of kT=0.5 to 3. 
%kT=0.5 to 38
We also generated a pressure-temperature
phase diagram, but the slope was notably steeper than that
predicted from Monte-Carlo simulations, giving transition 
pressures that were too high.

\begin{equation}{\widetilde{\vec{w}}_2(\vec{k})=\frac{4\pi{i}}{k^2}e^{-\frac{k^2\Xi^2}{8}}\left[\left(\frac{\Xi^2k}{4}+\frac{1}{k}\right)\sin\left(\frac{k\alpha}{2}\right)-\frac{\alpha}{2}\cos\left(\frac{k\alpha}{2}\right)\right]{~}\vec{k}}\end{equation} 

\section{Fourier Transform of Tensor Weight $w_{m2}$}
\begin{equation}{\overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r})=w_2(r)\left(\frac{\vec{r}\vec{r}}{r^2}-\frac{I}{3}\right)}\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}{w_2(r)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\Xi\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\left(\frac{r-\frac{\alpha}{2}}{\frac{\Xi}{\sqrt{2}}}\right)^2}}\end{equation}
Form the outer product
\begin{equation}{\vec{r}\vec{r}=\left(\begin{array}{c} r_x \\ r_y \\ r_z \end{array} \right) \left(\begin{array}{rrr} r_x & r_y & r_z \end{array} \right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} {r^2}_x & r_xr_y & r_xr_z \\ r_yr_x & {r_y}^2 & r_yr_z \\ r_zr_x & r_zr_y & {r_z}^2 \end{array}\right)}\end{equation}
and identity matrix
\begin{equation}{I=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right)}\end{equation}
The tensor weight matrix elements are then given by
\begin{equation}{w_{m2_{ij}}(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{a\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\left(\frac{r-\frac{\alpha}{2}}{a}\right)^2}\left(\frac{r_ir_j}{r^2}-\frac{\delta_{ij}}{3}\right)}\end{equation}
with temporarily setting
\begin{equation}{a=\frac{\Xi}{\sqrt{2}}}\end{equation}
The Fourier transform of the tensor weight matrix elements are given by
\begin{equation}{\widetilde{w}_{m2_{ij}}(\vec{k})=\int_{allspace}{w_{{m2}_{ij}}}(\vec{r})e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}}d{\vec{r}}}\end{equation}
Since the integration is over all space, the integral can be simplified 
by setting 
\begin{equation}{\vec{k}=k\hat{z}}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}{\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}=kr\cos\theta\hat{z}}\end{equation}
Instead of constraining vector $\vec{k}$ to be in the z direction, 
however, a rotated coordinate system $(x',y',z')$ is used which is 
rotated from the (x,y,z) coordinate system in such a way that $\hat{z}'$ 
points in the direction of vector $\vec{k}$. After solving for the 
elements of the transformed weight function in coordinate system 
$(x',y',z')$, they will be expressed again in terms of vector $\vec{k}$ 
as it appears in coordinate system (x,y,z) to get the elements of the 
transformed weight function in coordinate system (x,y,z).

\noindent Using the relation

\begin{displaymath}{\text{I} -\hat{z'}\hat{z'} = \hat{x'}\hat{x'} + \hat{y'}\hat{y'}}\end{displaymath}
and the results from earlier

\begin{equation}{\widetilde{w}_{{m2}_{z'z'}}=-2\widetilde{w}_{{m2}_{x'x'}}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}{\widetilde{w}_{m2}(\vec{k})= (\text{I}-3\hat{z}'\hat{z}')\widetilde{w}_{{m2}_{x'x'}}(\vec{k})}\end{equation}
\noindent In the $(x',y',z')$ coordinate system, vector $\vec{k}$ had 
been aligned with the $\hat{z}'$ direction so that

\begin{equation}{\widetilde{w}_{m2}(\vec{k})= (\text{I}-3\hat{k}\hat{k})\widetilde{w}_{{m2}_{x'x'}}(\vec{k})}\end{equation}
Now  $\vec{k}$ can be expressed in the $(x,y,z)$ coordinate system, 
$\vec{k}=k_x\hat{x} + k_y\hat{y} + k_z\hat{z}$. The components of the 
tensor weight in the $(x,y,z)$ coordinate system are then given by

\begin{displaymath}{\approx\frac{4\pi}{k^2}-\frac{\pi}{6}\left(\alpha^2-\Xi^2\right)}\end{displaymath}  

Adding the three terms gives:

\begin{equation}{\overleftrightarrow{n}_{m2}(\vec{r})=\int_{allspace}n(\vec{r'})\overleftrightarrow{w}_{m2}(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})d{\vec{r'}}}\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}{n_{m2ij}(\vec{r})=\int_{allspace}{n(\vec{r}')w_{m2ij}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}'){}d{\vec{r}'}}}\end{equation}
Using the definition of the delta function
\begin{equation}{\delta}((\vec{r}-\vec{r}')-\vec{r}'')={ \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int e^{i\vec k\cdot ((\vec r-\vec r')-\vec{r}'')}d\vec{k}}\end{equation} 
$w_{m2ij}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')$ can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    w_{m2ij}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}') &= \int{\delta((\vec{r}-\vec{r}')-\vec{r}'')w_{m2ij}(\vec{r}''){}d{\vec{r}''}} \\
    &= \int{\left(\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int e^{i\vec k\cdot((\vec r-\vec r')-\vec{r}'')}d\vec{k}\right){~}w_{m2ij}(\vec{r}''){}d{\vec{r}''}} \\

  \end{align} 
Putting this into the expression for $n_{m2ij}(\vec{r})$ gives 
\begin{align}
    n_{m2ij}(\vec r) &= \int n(\vec r') \left(\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int w_{m2ij}(\vec k)e^{i\vec k\cdot (\vec r-\vec r')}d\vec{k}\right)d\vec r' \\

\section{Deconvolution Equation for the Hard-Sphere Mayer Function} 

The Mayer function written in terms of convolutions of weight functions is
\begin{align}
    f(r)=-\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)= -2(w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1})  
\end{align}
where the mayer function of the hard-sphere fluid is 
\begin{align}
   f(r) &= e^{\frac{V(r)}{kBT}}-1 \\
        &= -\frac{\theta(|\vec r|-2R)}{2}
\end{align}
and $V(r)$ is given by
\begin{align}
    V(r)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} \infty & 0<r \leq 2R \\ 0  & r>2R \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
$\theta(|\vec r|-2R)$ is a backwards Heaviside step function 
given by 
\begin{align}
     \Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rc} 1 & 0<r \leq 2R \\ 0  & r>2R \end{array}\right.
\end{align}
We can verfy that 
\begin{align}  \label{equation-to-verify}
     \frac{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)}{2}= w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1}
\end{align}
by using the relation
\begin{align}
    f \otimes g = \text{I.F.T.[ F.T.}[f]\text{ x F.T.[g] }]
\end{align} 
\begin{align}\label{FTdecon}
    F.T.\left(\frac{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)}{2}\right) 
        &= F.T.\left[w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1}\right]  \nonumber \\                                                  
        &= F.T.\left[I.F.T\left(\widetilde{w}_3\widetilde{w}_0 + \widetilde{w}_2\widetilde{w}_1 + \widetilde{\vec w}_2 \cdot \widetilde{\vec w}_1\right)\right]  \nonumber \\
        &= \widetilde{w}_3\widetilde{w}_0 + \widetilde{w}_2\widetilde{w}_1 + \widetilde{\vec w}_2 \cdot \widetilde{\vec w}_1 
\end{align}

Setting $\hat k$ in the $\hat z'$ direction, the right hand of Equation~\ref{FTdecon} gives
\begin{align} \label{leftside} 
    F.T.\left(\frac{\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)}{2}\right) 
       &=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\pi \int_{-1}^1\int_0^{2R}(1)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}r^2~dr~d\cos \theta'~d\phi'  \nonumber  \\
       &=\frac{2\pi}{2}\int_0^{2R} r^2~dr\int_{-1}^1 e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}~d\cos \theta'~d\phi' \nonumber   \\
       &=\pi\int_0^{2R} r^2\left(\frac{2\sin (kr)}{kr}\right)~dr \nonumber  \\
       &=\frac{2\pi}{k}\int_0^{2R} r\sin (kr)~dr \nonumber  \\
       &=\frac{2\pi}{k}\left[\frac{\sin (kr)-kr\cos (kr))}{k^2}\right] \bigg|_0^{2R} \nonumber  \\
       &= \frac{2\pi}{k^3}\sin (2kR)-\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\cos (2kR) \nonumber  \\
       &= \frac{4\pi}{k^3}\sin (kR)\cos (kR) - \frac{4 \pi R}{k^2}\cos^2 (kR) + \frac{4\pi R}{k^2} \sin^2 (kR)
\end{align}

The Fourier transforms of the hard-sphere weight functions give
\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_2 &= \int\int\int\delta(r-R)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'} r^2~dr~d\cos \theta'~d\phi  \nonumber  \\
                    &= 2\pi\int\delta(r-R)r^2 \frac{2\sin (kr)}{kr}~dr \nonumber  \\
                    &= 2\pi R^2 \frac{2\sin (kR)}{kR} \nonumber  \\
                    &= \frac{4\pi R}{k} \sin (kR)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_1 &= \frac{\widetilde{w}_2}{4\pi R}= \frac{\sin (kR)}{k} 
                    %&= \frac{\sin (kR)}{k} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_0 &= \frac{\widetilde{w}_2}{4\pi R^2}= \frac{\sin (kR)}{kR}
                   % &= \frac{\sin (kR)}{kR} 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_3 &= \int\int\int\theta(r-R)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}r^2~dr~d\cos\theta'~d\phi  \nonumber \\
                    &= 2\pi\int\theta(r-R)\left(\frac{2\sin (kr)}{kr}\right)r^2~dr  \nonumber  \\
                    &= \frac{4\pi}{k}\int_0^R (1)r\sin (kr)~dr  \nonumber  \\
                    &= \frac{4\pi}{k}\left[\frac{\sin (kr) - kr\cos (kr)}{k^2}\right]\bigg|_0^R  \nonumber  \\
                    &= \frac{4\pi}{k^3}\left[\sin (kR) - kR\cos (kR)\right]
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{\vec w}_2  &= \int\int\int\delta(r-R)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}r^2~\frac{\vec r}{r}~dr~d\cos\theta'~d\phi \nonumber  \\
                          &= \int\int\int\delta(r-R)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}r~(r_{x'} \hat x' + r_{y'} \hat y'+ r_{z'} \hat z')~dr~d\cos\theta'~d\phi  
\end{align}
Again $\vec{k}$ is set in the direction of $\hat{z}'$ of a rotated coordinate 
system $(x',y'z')$ where
\begin{align}
     r_{x'} &= r\sin\theta'\cos\phi'  \\
     r_{y'} &= r\sin\theta'\sin\phi'   \\
     r_{z'} &= r\cos\theta'  \\
     \text{and~~~} r &=|\vec r| = |\vec r'|
\end{align}
The terms in the $\hat x'$ and $\hat y'$ direction give zero due to symmetry ($\int_0^{2\pi} \cos \phi ~d\phi= 0$ and $\int_0^{2\pi} \sin \phi~d\phi= 0$), 
and so only the term in the $\hat z'$ direction remains.

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{\vec w}_2  &= \int\int\int\delta(r-R)e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}r~(r\cos \theta')~dr~d\cos\theta'~d\phi~\hat k  \nonumber  \\
                          &= 2\pi\int\delta(r-R)r^2~dr\int_{-1}^1 e^{-ikr\cos \theta'}\cos \theta'~d\cos\theta'~\hat k  \nonumber  \\
                          &= 2\pi\int\delta(r-R)r^2 \left(\frac{-2i}{kr}\cos (kr)+ \frac{2i}{k^2r^2}\sin (kr)\right)dr~\hat k  \nonumber  \\
                          &= 2\pi\left[\frac{-2iR}{k}\cos (kR)+ \frac{2i}{k^2}\sin (kR)\right]~\hat k \nonumber   \\
                          &= \left(\frac{-4\pi iR}{k}\cos (kR)+ \frac{4\pi i}{k^2}\sin (kR)\right)\hat k 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{\vec w}_1  &= \frac{\widetilde{\vec w}_2}{4\pi R}  \nonumber  \\
                          &= \left(\frac{-i}{k}\cos (kR)+ \frac{i}{Rk^2}\sin (kR)\right)\hat k
\end{align}
The terms on the right side of Equation~\ref{FTdecon} are then
\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_0\widetilde{w}_3 &= \left(\frac{\sin (kR)}{kR}\right)\left(\frac{4\pi}{k^3}\left[\sin (kR) - kR\cos (kR)\right]\right) \nonumber  \\
                                   &= \frac{4\pi}{k^4R}\sin^2 (kR) - \frac{4\pi}{k^3}\sin(kR)\cos(kR)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_1\widetilde{w}_2 &= \left(\frac{\sin (kR)}{k}\right)\left(\frac{4\pi R}{k} \sin (kR)\right) \nonumber  \\                                
                                   &= \frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\sin^2 (kR)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
   \widetilde{\vec w}_1\cdot\widetilde{\vec w}_2   
    &= \left(\frac{-4\pi iR}{k}\cos (kR)+ \frac{4\pi i}{k^2}\sin (kR)\right)\hat k \cdot \left(\frac{-i}{k}\cos (kR)+ \frac{i}{Rk^2}\sin (kR)\right) \hat k  \nonumber  \\
    &= -\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\cos^2(kR) + \frac{8\pi}{k^3}\sin(kR)\cos(kR) - \frac{4\pi}{Rk^4}\sin^2(kR)
\end{align}
Adding the terms together gives
\begin{align}
    \widetilde{w}_3\widetilde{w}_0 + \widetilde{w}_2\widetilde{w}_1 + \widetilde{\vec w}_2 \cdot \widetilde{\vec w}_1 
    &= \frac{4\pi}{k^4R}\sin^2 (kR) - \frac{4\pi}{k^3}\sin(kR)\cos(kR) \nonumber  \\
    &+ \frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\sin^2 (kR) \nonumber  \\
    &- \frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\cos^2(kR) + \frac{8\pi}{k^3}\sin(kR)\cos(kR) -  \frac{4\pi}{Rk^4}\sin^2(kR) \nonumber  \\                                                                                                                     
    &= \left(\frac{4\pi}{k^4R}+\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}-\frac{4\pi}{k^4R}\right)\sin^2(kR) \nonumber   \\
    &-\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\cos^2(kR) +\left(-\frac{4\pi}{k^3} + \frac{8\pi}{k^3}\right)\sin(kR)\cos(kR) \nonumber   \\                                                                                                                  
    &=\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\sin^2(kR)-\frac{4\pi R}{k^2}\cos^2(kR)+\frac{4\pi}{k^3}\sin(kR)\cos(kR)
\end{align}
which equals Equation~\ref{leftside}, and so
%\begin{align}
     %\Theta(|\vec{r}|-2R)= 2(w_3 \otimes w_0 + w_2 \otimes w_1 + \vec{w_2} \otimes \vec{w_1})
%\end{align}
Equation~\ref{equation-to-verify} is satisfied.

\section{Second Virial Coefficient $B_{2}$ for the Error Function Potential}
\begin{equation}B_2=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{allspace}f(\vec{r})d\vec r\end{equation}
The Mayer function for the Error Function potential $V_{\operatorname{erf}}$ is
\begin{equation}f(r)=\frac{1}{2}\left[\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)-1\right]\end{equation} 
from which it can be seen that $f(r)$ is approximately 0 for $r>r_{max}$ 
where $r_{max}$ is some maximum value of $r$.
\begin{align}
 B_2 &= -\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{2}\left[\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)-1\right]r^2\sin{\theta}d{\theta}d{\phi}dr \nonumber  \\
     &= -\frac{1}{2}4\pi\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{r_{max}}\left[\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)-1\right]r^2dr \nonumber  \\
     &= -\pi\int_{0}^{r_{max}}\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)r^2dr {~~}+{~~} \pi\int_0^{r_{max}}r^2dr  \nonumber  \\

\end{align}

\begin{align}
  B_2 &= \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\alpha^3-\frac{\pi}{2}\alpha\Xi^2+\frac{\pi}{3}r_{max}^3\right)\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{\alpha-r_{max}}{\Xi}\right) \nonumber \\
      &+ \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\alpha^3+\frac{\pi}{2}\alpha\Xi^2\right)\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right) \nonumber \\
      &+ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}\left(-\Xi\alpha^2-\Xi\alpha r_{max}-\Xi^3-\Xi r_{max}^2\right)e^{-{\left(\frac{\alpha-r_{max}}{\Xi}\right)^2}} \nonumber \\
      &+ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}\left(\Xi\alpha^2+\Xi^3\right)e^{-\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}+\frac{\pi}{3}r_{max}^3 
\end{align}
Letting $r_{max}\rightarrow\infty$ this becomes
\begin{align}
  B_2 &= \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\alpha^3-\frac{\pi}{2}\alpha\Xi^2+\frac{\pi}{3}\left(\infty\right)^3\right)\left(-1\right) \nonumber \\

      &+ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}\left(\Xi\alpha^2+\Xi^3\right)e^{-\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}+\frac{\pi}{3}\left(\infty\right)^3 
\end{align}
\begin{equation}B_2 = \frac{\pi}{3}\Xi^3\left[\left(\frac{\alpha^3}{\Xi^3}+\frac{3\alpha}{2\Xi}\right)\left(1+\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)\right)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{\Xi^2}+1\right)e^{-\left(\frac{\alpha}{\Xi}\right)^2}\right]\end{equation}

\section{Third Virial Coefficient $B_{3}$ General Approach}

\begin{equation}\label{B3}B_3=-\frac{1}{3}\int_{allspace}\int_{allspace}f(\vec{r})f(\vec{r'})f(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})d\vec rd\vec r'\end{equation}

First find
\begin{equation}f(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})=\int_{allspace}f(\vec{r''})\delta(\vec{r}''-(\vec{r}-\vec{r}'))d\vec r'' \end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}{\delta}(\vec{r}''-(\vec{r}-\vec{r}'))={ \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int_{allspace} e^{i\vec k\cdot (\vec{r}''-(\vec r-\vec r'))}d\vec{k}}\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}f(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})=\int{f(\vec{r''})\left( \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int e^{i\vec k\cdot (\vec{r}''-(\vec r-\vec r'))}d\vec{k} \right) d\vec r''} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}f(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})=\int{ e^{-i\vec k\cdot (\vec r-\vec r')}\left(\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^3}\int{f(\vec{r''}) e^{i\vec k\cdot (\vec{r}'')}d\vec{r''}} \right) d\vec k} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}f(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})=\int{ e^{-i\vec k\cdot \vec r}e^{i\vec k\cdot \vec r}\widetilde{f}(-\vec k) d\vec k} \end{equation}

Putting this result into Eq~\ref{B3} gives
\begin{equation}B_3=-\frac{1}{3}\int{\int{f(\vec{r})f(\vec{r'})\left(\int{ e^{-i\vec k\cdot \vec r}e^{i\vec k\cdot \vec r}\widetilde{f}(-\vec k) d\vec k}\right)d\vec rd\vec r'}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}B_3=-\frac{1}{3}\int{\widetilde{f}(-\vec k)\left(\int{f(\vec{r})e^{-i\vec k\cdot \vec r}}d\vec r\int{f(\vec{r'})e^{i\vec k\cdot \vec r'} d\vec r'}\right)d\vec k}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}B_3=-\frac{1}{3}\int{\widetilde{f}(-\vec k)\widetilde{f}(\vec k)\widetilde{f}(-\vec k)d\vec k}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}B_3=-\frac{1}{3}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\infty}{|\widetilde{f}(\vec k)|^3d\vec k}\end{equation}

Since the Mayer function does not depend on $\phi$ and $\theta$, this reduced to
\begin{equation}B_3=-\frac{4\pi}{3}\int{|\widetilde{f}(\vec k)|^3k^2dk}\end{equation}

The Mayer function for the Error Function potential $V_{\operatorname{erf}}$, 
and its Fourier Transform are
\begin{equation}f_{\operatorname{erf}}(r)=\frac{1}{2}\left[\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha}{\Xi}\right)-1\right]\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}\widetilde{f}_{\operatorname{erf}}(k)=-\frac{4\pi}{k^3}e^{-\frac{k^2\Xi^2}{4}}\left[\left(1+\frac{k^2\Xi^2}{2}\right)\sin(k\alpha)-k\alpha\cos(k\alpha)\right]\end{equation} 

The Mayer function for the WCA potential $V_{WCA}$, and its Fourier Transform are
 
\begin{equation}f_{WCA}(r)=\operatorname{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{k_BT}\left[4\epsilon\left(\sigma^{12}r^{-12}-\sigma^{6}r^{-6}\right)+\epsilon\right]\color{white}\frac{1}{1}\color{black}\right)-1\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}\widetilde{f}_{WCA}(k)=\frac{4\pi}{k}\int_0^{\infty}{\left(e^{-\frac{1}{k_BT}\left[4\epsilon\left(\sigma^{12}r^{-12}-\sigma^{6}r^{-6}\right)+\epsilon\right]}-1\right) r\sin(kr)dr}\end{equation} 


\section{General Derivation of the Virial Equation}
The second virial coefficient can be derived from Euler's equation for 
the internal energy of a system.
\begin{equation}PV=TS-(U-\mu{N})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{Euler_rearranged}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\frac{S}{k_B}-\frac{1}{k_BT}(U-\mu{N})\end{equation}
Setting $\beta=\frac{1}{k_BT}$, and putting in the relations from statistical 
thermophysics which views the thermodynamic quantities as ensemble averages
\begin{equation}S=-k_B\sum_{i=0}^\infty{P_i\ln{P_i}}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}U=<E>=\sum_{i=0}^\infty{P_iE_i}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}N=<n>=\sum_{i=0}^\infty{P_in_i}\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{Euler_rearranged} then becomes
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum{P_i\ln{P_i}}-\sum{P_i\beta(E_i-\mu
{n_i}})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum{P_i}\left[\ln{P_i}+\beta(E_i-\mu
{n_i})\right]\end{equation}
For a Grand Canonical Ensemble the probability of a state given by
\begin{equation}P_{n,s(n)}=\frac{e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}\end{equation}
results in 
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}P_{n,s(n)}\left[\ln{\left(\frac{ e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}\right)}+\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})\right]\end{equation}

%KEEP%\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}P_{n,s(n)}\left[-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})-\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)}+\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})\right]\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   \frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}P_{n,s(n)}\left[-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})-\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)}\color{white}\right]\color{black} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   \color{white}\left[-\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)}\color{black}+\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})\right]\color{black}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}\left(\frac{e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}} \left[-\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)}\right]\right)\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\left[\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)}\right]\left(\frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}}\right) \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta(E_{s(n)}-\mu{n})}\right)} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(e^{\beta\mu}\right)^n\sum_{s(n)}e^{-\beta{E}_{s(n)}}\right)} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^nZ_n\right)} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\ln{\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^nZ_{on}Q_n\right)} \end{equation}
where $Q_n$ is the configuration integral.
For a system of N particles only, the sum collapses to one term, 
that for n=N, which gives 
\begin{equation}\label{PV/kBT_reduces_for_N}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\ln{\left(\lambda^NZ_{oN}Q_N\right)}
=\beta\mu{N} + \ln{Z}_{oN} +\ln{Q}_N\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{PV/kBT_reduces_for_N}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=\beta\mu_{ideal}{N} + \ln{Z}_{oN} + \beta\mu_{excess}{N} + \ln{Q}_N\end{equation}
Noting that $Q_N=1$ for an ideal gas since $V(r)=0$ for an ideal gas
\begin{equation}\frac{P_{ideal}V}{k_BT}=\beta\mu_{ideal}{N} + \ln{Z}_{oN}=N\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{P_{excess}}{k_BT}= \beta\mu_{excess}{N} + \ln{Q}_N\end{equation}
and Equation~\ref{PV/kBT_reduces_for_N} becomes
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N + \beta\mu_{excess}{N} + \ln{Q}_N\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N + \beta\frac{\partial{F}_{excess}}{\partial{N}}{N} - \frac{F_{excess}}{k_BT}\end{equation}
Plugging in the expression for $F_{excess}$ in terms of the Mayer function 
for low density fluids
\begin{equation}F_{excess}=k_BT\frac{N^2}{V}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\int{f(r)d\vec{r}}\right)\end{equation}
gives
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N + \left(-\frac{N}{V}\int{f(r)d\vec{r}}\right){N} + \frac{N^2}{V}\frac{1}{2}\int{f(r)d\vec{r}}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N\left(1-\frac{N}{V}\frac{1}{2}\int{f(r)d\vec{r}}\right)\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N\left(1+\frac{N}{V}B_2(T)\right) \end{equation}
where $B_2(T)$ is given by
\begin{equation}B_2=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{Volume}f(r)d\vec{r} \end{equation}

This result was for low densities where higher terms in the 
expression for the excess free energy were neglected. The full virial 
equation is given by
\begin{equation}\frac{PV}{k_BT}=N\left(1+\frac{N}{V}B_2(T)+\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^2B_3(T)+ \cdot\cdot\cdot\right) \end{equation}

\begin{equation}P_{eq}(\vec r^N, \vec p^N)=\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\frac{e^{-\beta H}}{\text{partian function}}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}{\text{partian function}}=\frac{1}{N!}\frac{1}{h^{3N}}\int\dot~\dot~\dot~\int e^{-\beta H} d\vec r^{N} d\vec p^{N}\end{equation}
