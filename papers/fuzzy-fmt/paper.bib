abstract = {Small and large hydrophobic solutes exhibit remarkably different hydration thermodynamics. Small solutes are accommodated in water with minor perturbations to water structure, and their hydration is captured accurately by theories that describe density fluctuations in pure water. In contrast, hydration of large solutes is accompanied by dewetting of their surfaces and requires a macroscopic thermodynamic description. A unified theoretical description of these lengthscale dependencies was presented by Lum, Chandler, and Weeks [(1999) J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570-4577]. Here, we use molecular simulations to study lengthscale-dependent hydrophobic hydration under various thermodynamic conditions. We show that the hydration of small and large solutes displays disparate dependencies on thermodynamic variables, including pressure, temperature, and additive concentration. Understanding these dependencies allows manipulation of the small-to-large crossover lengthscale, which is nanoscopic under ambient conditions. Specifically, applying hydrostatic tension or adding ethanol decreases the crossover length to molecular sizes, making it accessible to atomistic simulations. With detailed temperature-dependent studies, we further demonstrate that hydration thermodynamics changes gradually from entropic to enthalpic near the crossover. The nanoscopic lengthscale of the crossover and its sensitivity to thermodynamic variables imply that quantitative modeling of biomolecular self-assembly in aqueous solutions requires elements of both molecular and macroscopic hydration physics. We also show that the small-to-large crossover is directly related to the Egelstaff-Widom lengthscale, the product of surface tension and isothermal compressibility, which is another fundamental lengthscale in liquids.

abstract = {Electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in many biomolecular processes, including molecular recognition and binding. Biomolecular electrostatics is modulated to a large extent by the water surrounding the molecules. Here, we present a novel approach to the computation of electrostatic potentials which allows the inclusion of water structure into the classical theory of continuum electrostatics. Based on our recent purely differential formulation of nonlocal electrostatics [Hildebrandt, et al. (2004) Phys. Rev. Lett., 93, 108104] we have developed a new algorithm for its efficient numerical solution. The key component of this algorithm is a boundary element solver, having the same computational complexity as established boundary element methods for local continuum electrostatics. This allows, for the first time, the computation of electrostatic potentials and interactions of large biomolecular systems immersed in water including effects of the solvent's structure in a continuum description. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with two examples, the enzymes trypsin and acetylcholinesterase. The approach is applicable to all problems requiring precise prediction of electrostatic interactions in water, such as protein-ligand and protein-protein docking, folding and chromatin regulation. Initial results indicate that this approach may shed new light on biomolecular electrostatics and on aspects of molecular recognition that classical local electrostatics cannot reveal.

abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) computer simulations are used to calculated the bulk modulus for a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer. A methodology is developed whereby NEMD can be effectively used to calculate material properties for complex systems that undergo long time-scale conformational changes. It is found that the bulk modulus upon expansion from a zero stress state agrees well with experimental estimates. However, it is also found that the modulus upon contraction from a zero stress state is larger. From a molecular perspective, it is possible to explain this phenomena by examining the molecular origins of the pressure response. The finding that the two moduli are not equal upon compression and expansion is in apparent contradiction to osmotic stress experiments where the area modulus was found to be the same upon expansion and contraction. This issue is addressed.
